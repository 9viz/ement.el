The client-server API provides a simple lightweight API to let clients send messages, control rooms and synchronise conversation history. It is designed to support both lightweight clients which store no state and lazy-load data from the server as required - as well as heavyweight clients which maintain a full local persistent copy of server state.

* [[#id174][2   API Standards]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: api-standards
:END:

The mandatory baseline for client-server communication in Matrix is exchanging JSON objects over HTTP APIs. HTTPS is recommended for communication, although HTTP may be supported as a fallback to support basic HTTP clients. More efficient optional transports will in future be supported as optional extensions - e.g. a packed binary encoding over stream-cipher encrypted TCP socket for low-bandwidth/low-roundtrip mobile usage. For the default HTTP transport, all API calls use a Content-Type of =application/json=. In addition, all strings MUST be encoded as UTF-8. Clients are authenticated using opaque =access_token= strings (see [[#client-authentication][Client Authentication]] for details), passed as a query string parameter on all requests.

The names of the API endpoints for the HTTP transport follow a convention of using underscores to separate words (for example =/delete_devices=). The key names in JSON objects passed over the API also follow this convention.

Note

There are a few historical exceptions to this rule, such as =/createRoom=. A future version of this specification will address the inconsistency.

Any errors which occur at the Matrix API level MUST return a "standard error response". This is a JSON object which looks like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "<error code>",
  "error": "<error message>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =error= string will be a human-readable error message, usually a sentence explaining what went wrong. The =errcode= string will be a unique string which can be used to handle an error message e.g. =M_FORBIDDEN=. These error codes should have their namespace first in ALL CAPS, followed by a single \_ to ease separating the namespace from the error code. For example, if there was a custom namespace =com.mydomain.here=, and a =FORBIDDEN= code, the error code should look like =COM.MYDOMAIN.HERE_FORBIDDEN=. There may be additional keys depending on the error, but the keys =error= and =errcode= MUST always be present.

Errors are generally best expressed by their error code rather than the HTTP status code returned. When encountering the error code =M_UNKNOWN=, clients should prefer the HTTP status code as a more reliable reference for what the issue was. For example, if the client receives an error code of =M_NOT_FOUND= but the request gave a 400 Bad Request status code, the client should treat the error as if the resource was not found. However, if the client were to receive an error code of =M_UNKNOWN= with a 400 Bad Request, the client should assume that the request being made was invalid.

The common error codes are:

=M_FORBIDDEN=:

Forbidden access, e.g. joining a room without permission, failed login.

=M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN=:

 

The access token specified was not recognised.

An additional response parameter, =soft_logout=, might be present on the response for 401 HTTP status codes. See [[#soft-logout][the soft logout section]] for more information.

=M_MISSING_TOKEN=:

 

No access token was specified for the request.

=M_BAD_JSON=:

Request contained valid JSON, but it was malformed in some way, e.g. missing required keys, invalid values for keys.

=M_NOT_JSON=:

Request did not contain valid JSON.

=M_NOT_FOUND=:

No resource was found for this request.

=M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED=:

 

Too many requests have been sent in a short period of time. Wait a while then try again.

=M_UNKNOWN=:

An unknown error has occurred.

Other error codes the client might encounter are:

=M_UNRECOGNIZED=:

The server did not understand the request.

=M_UNAUTHORIZED=:

The request was not correctly authorized. Usually due to login failures.

=M_USER_DEACTIVATED=:

 

The user ID associated with the request has been deactivated. Typically for endpoints that prove authentication, such as =/login=.

=M_USER_IN_USE=:

Encountered when trying to register a user ID which has been taken.

=M_INVALID_USERNAME=:

 

Encountered when trying to register a user ID which is not valid.

=M_ROOM_IN_USE=:

Sent when the room alias given to the =createRoom= API is already in use.

=M_INVALID_ROOM_STATE=:

 

Sent when the initial state given to the =createRoom= API is invalid.

=M_THREEPID_IN_USE=:

 

Sent when a threepid given to an API cannot be used because the same threepid is already in use.

=M_THREEPID_NOT_FOUND=:

 

Sent when a threepid given to an API cannot be used because no record matching the threepid was found.

=M_THREEPID_AUTH_FAILED=:

 

Authentication could not be performed on the third party identifier.

=M_THREEPID_DENIED=:

 

The server does not permit this third party identifier. This may happen if the server only permits, for example, email addresses from a particular domain.

=M_SERVER_NOT_TRUSTED=:

 

The client's request used a third party server, eg. identity server, that this server does not trust.

=M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION=:

 

The client's request to create a room used a room version that the server does not support.

=M_INCOMPATIBLE_ROOM_VERSION=:

 

The client attempted to join a room that has a version the server does not support. Inspect the =room_version= property of the error response for the room's version.

=M_BAD_STATE=:

The state change requested cannot be performed, such as attempting to unban a user who is not banned.

=M_GUEST_ACCESS_FORBIDDEN=:

 

The room or resource does not permit guests to access it.

=M_CAPTCHA_NEEDED=:

 

A Captcha is required to complete the request.

=M_CAPTCHA_INVALID=:

 

The Captcha provided did not match what was expected.

=M_MISSING_PARAM=:

 

A required parameter was missing from the request.

=M_INVALID_PARAM=:

 

A parameter that was specified has the wrong value. For example, the server expected an integer and instead received a string.

=M_TOO_LARGE=:

The request or entity was too large.

=M_EXCLUSIVE=:

The resource being requested is reserved by an application service, or the application service making the request has not created the resource.

=M_RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED=:

 

The request cannot be completed because the homeserver has reached a resource limit imposed on it. For example, a homeserver held in a shared hosting environment may reach a resource limit if it starts using too much memory or disk space. The error MUST have an =admin_contact= field to provide the user receiving the error a place to reach out to. Typically, this error will appear on routes which attempt to modify state (eg: sending messages, account data, etc) and not routes which only read state (eg: =/sync=, get account data, etc).

=M_CANNOT_LEAVE_SERVER_NOTICE_ROOM=:

 

The user is unable to reject an invite to join the server notices room. See the [[#server-notices][Server Notices]] module for more information.

The client-server API typically uses =HTTP PUT= to submit requests with a client-generated transaction identifier. This means that these requests are idempotent. The scope of a transaction identifier is a particular access token. It *only* serves to identify new requests from retransmits. After the request has finished, the ={txnId}= value should be changed (how is not specified; a monotonically increasing integer is recommended).

Some API endpoints may allow or require the use of =POST= requests without a transaction ID. Where this is optional, the use of a =PUT= request is strongly recommended.

** [[#id175][2.1   =GET /_matrix/client/versions=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: get-_matrixclientversions
:END:

Gets the versions of the specification supported by the server.

Values will take the form =rX.Y.Z=.

Only the latest =Z= value will be reported for each supported =X.Y= value. i.e. if the server implements =r0.0.0=, =r0.0.1=, and =r1.2.0=, it will report =r0.0.1= and =r1.2.0=.

The server may additionally advertise experimental features it supports through =unstable_features=. These features should be namespaced and may optionally include version information within their name if desired. Features listed here are not for optionally toggling parts of the Matrix specification and should only be used to advertise support for a feature which has not yet landed in the spec. For example, a feature currently undergoing the proposal process may appear here and eventually be taken off this list once the feature lands in the spec and the server deems it reasonable to do so. Servers may wish to keep advertising features here after they've been released into the spec to give clients a chance to upgrade appropriately. Additionally, clients should avoid using unstable features in their stable releases.

* [[#id176][3   Web Browser Clients]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: web-browser-clients
:END:

It is realistic to expect that some clients will be written to be run within a web browser or similar environment. In these cases, the homeserver should respond to pre-flight requests and supply Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers on all requests.

Servers MUST expect that clients will approach them with =OPTIONS= requests, allowing clients to discover the CORS headers. All endpoints in this specification s upport the =OPTIONS= method, however the server MUST NOT perform any logic defined for the endpoints when approached with an =OPTIONS= request.

When a client approaches the server with a request, the server should respond with the CORS headers for that route. The recommended CORS headers to be returned by servers on all requests are:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization
#+END_EXAMPLE

* [[#id177][4   Server Discovery]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-discovery
:END:

In order to allow users to connect to a Matrix server without needing to explicitly specify the homeserver's URL or other parameters, clients SHOULD use an auto-discovery mechanism to determine the server's URL based on a user's Matrix ID. Auto-discovery should only be done at login time.

In this section, the following terms are used with specific meanings:

- =PROMPT= :: Retrieve the specific piece of information from the user in a way which fits within the existing client user experience, if the client is inclined to do so. Failure can take place instead if no good user experience for this is possible at this point.
- =IGNORE= :: Stop the current auto-discovery mechanism. If no more auto-discovery mechanisms are available, then the client may use other methods of determining the required parameters, such as prompting the user, or using default values.
- =FAIL_PROMPT= :: Inform the user that auto-discovery failed due to invalid/empty data and =PROMPT= for the parameter.
- =FAIL_ERROR= :: Inform the user that auto-discovery did not return any usable URLs. Do not continue further with the current login process. At this point, valid data was obtained, but no server is available to serve the client. No further guess should be attempted and the user should make a conscientious decision what to do next.

** [[#id178][4.1   Well-known URI]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: well-known-uri
:END:

Note

Servers hosting the =.well-known= JSON file SHOULD offer CORS headers, as per the [[#cors][CORS]] section in this specification.

The =.well-known= method uses a JSON file at a predetermined location to specify parameter values. The flow for this method is as follows:

1. Extract the server name from the user's Matrix ID by splitting the Matrix ID at the first colon.
2. Extract the hostname from the server name.
3. Make a GET request to =https://hostname/.well-known/matrix/client=.

   1. If the returned status code is 404, then =IGNORE=.
   2. If the returned status code is not 200, or the response body is empty, then =FAIL_PROMPT=.
   3. Parse the response body as a JSON object

      1. If the content cannot be parsed, then =FAIL_PROMPT=.

   4. Extract the =base_url= value from the =m.homeserver= property. This value is to be used as the base URL of the homeserver.

      1. If this value is not provided, then =FAIL_PROMPT=.

   5. Validate the homeserver base URL:

      1. Parse it as a URL. If it is not a URL, then =FAIL_ERROR=.
      2. Clients SHOULD validate that the URL points to a valid homeserver before accepting it by connecting to the [[#get-matrix-client-versions][=/_matrix/client/versions=]] endpoint, ensuring that it does not return an error, and parsing and validating that the data conforms with the expected response format. If any step in the validation fails, then =FAIL_ERROR=. Validation is done as a simple check against configuration errors, in order to ensure that the discovered address points to a valid homeserver.

   6. If the =m.identity_server= property is present, extract the =base_url= value for use as the base URL of the identity server. Validation for this URL is done as in the step above, but using =/_matrix/identity/api/v1= as the endpoint to connect to. If the =m.identity_server= property is present, but does not have a =base_url= value, then =FAIL_ERROR=.

*** [[#id179][4.1.1   =GET /.well-known/matrix/client=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: get-.well-knownmatrixclient
:END:

Gets discovery information about the domain. The file may include additional keys, which MUST follow the Java package naming convention, e.g. =com.example.myapp.property=. This ensures property names are suitably namespaced for each application and reduces the risk of clashes.

Note that this endpoint is not necessarily handled by the homeserver, but by another webserver, to be used for discovering the homeserver URL.

* [[#id180][5   Client Authentication]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-authentication
:END:

Most API endpoints require the user to identify themselves by presenting previously obtained credentials in the form of an =access_token= query parameter or through an Authorization Header of =Bearer $access_token=. An access token is typically obtained via the [[#login][Login]] or [[#registration][Registration]] processes.

Note

This specification does not mandate a particular format for the access token. Clients should treat it as an opaque byte sequence. Servers are free to choose an appropriate format. Server implementors may like to investigate [[http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html][macaroons]].

** [[#id181][5.1   Using access tokens]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: using-access-tokens
:END:

Access tokens may be provided in two ways, both of which the homeserver MUST support:

1. Via a query string parameter, =access_token=TheTokenHere=.
2. Via a request header, =Authorization: Bearer TheTokenHere=.

Clients are encouraged to use the =Authorization= header where possible to prevent the access token being leaked in access/HTTP logs. The query string should only be used in cases where the =Authorization= header is inaccessible for the client.

When credentials are required but missing or invalid, the HTTP call will return with a status of 401 and the error code, =M_MISSING_TOKEN= or =M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN= respectively.

** [[#id182][5.2   Relationship between access tokens and devices]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: relationship-between-access-tokens-and-devices
:END:

Client [[../index.html#devices][devices]] are closely related to access tokens. Matrix servers should record which device each access token is assigned to, so that subsequent requests can be handled correctly.

By default, the [[#login][Login]] and [[#registration][Registration]] processes auto-generate a new =device_id=. A client is also free to generate its own =device_id= or, provided the user remains the same, reuse a device: in either case the client should pass the =device_id= in the request body. If the client sets the =device_id=, the server will invalidate any access token previously assigned to that device. There is therefore at most one active access token assigned to each device at any one time.

** [[#id183][5.3   Soft logout]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: soft-logout
:END:

When a request fails due to a 401 status code per above, the server can include an extra response parameter, =soft_logout=, to indicate if the client's persisted information can be retained. This defaults to =false=, indicating that the server has destroyed the session. Any persisted state held by the client, such as encryption keys and device information, must not be reused and must be discarded.

When =soft_logout= is true, the client can acquire a new access token by specifying the device ID it is already using to the login API. In most cases a =soft_logout: true= response indicates that the user's session has expired on the server-side and the user simply needs to provide their credentials again.

In either case, the client's previously known access token will no longer function.

** [[#id184][5.4   User-Interactive Authentication API]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-interactive-authentication-api
:END:

*** [[#id185][5.4.1   Overview]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:

Some API endpoints require authentication that interacts with the user. The homeserver may provide many different ways of authenticating, such as user/password auth, login via a social network (OAuth2), login by confirming a token sent to their email address, etc. This specification does not define how homeservers should authorise their users but instead defines the standard interface which implementations should follow so that ANY client can login to ANY homeserver.

The process takes the form of one or more 'stages'. At each stage the client submits a set of data for a given authentication type and awaits a response from the server, which will either be a final success or a request to perform an additional stage. This exchange continues until the final success.

For each endpoint, a server offers one or more 'flows' that the client can use to authenticate itself. Each flow comprises a series of stages, as described above. The client is free to choose which flow it follows, however the flow's stages must be completed in order. Failing to follow the flows in order must result in an HTTP 401 response, as defined below. When all stages in a flow are complete, authentication is complete and the API call succeeds.

*** [[#id186][5.4.2   User-interactive API in the REST API]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-interactive-api-in-the-rest-api
:END:

In the REST API described in this specification, authentication works by the client and server exchanging JSON dictionaries. The server indicates what authentication data it requires via the body of an HTTP 401 response, and the client submits that authentication data via the =auth= request parameter.

A client should first make a request with no =auth= parameter [[#id21][[1]]]. The homeserver returns an HTTP 401 response, with a JSON body, as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "flows": [
  {
  "stages": [ "example.type.foo", "example.type.bar" ]
  },
  {
  "stages": [ "example.type.foo", "example.type.baz" ]
  }
  ],
  "params": {
  "example.type.baz": {
  "example_key": "foobar"
  }
  },
  "session": "xxxxxx"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

In addition to the =flows=, this object contains some extra information:

- params :: This section contains any information that the client will need to know in order to use a given type of authentication. For each authentication type presented, that type may be present as a key in this dictionary. For example, the public part of an OAuth client ID could be given here.
- session :: This is a session identifier that the client must pass back to the homeserver, if one is provided, in subsequent attempts to authenticate in the same API call.

The client then chooses a flow and attempts to complete the first stage. It does this by resubmitting the same request with the addition of an =auth= key in the object that it submits. This dictionary contains a =type= key whose value is the name of the authentication type that the client is attempting to complete. It must also contain a =session= key with the value of the session key given by the homeserver, if one was given. It also contains other keys dependent on the auth type being attempted. For example, if the client is attempting to complete auth type =example.type.foo=, it might submit something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  POST /_matrix/client/r0/endpoint HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "a_request_parameter": "something",
  "another_request_parameter": "something else",
  "auth": {
  "type": "example.type.foo",
  "session": "xxxxxx",
  "example_credential": "verypoorsharedsecret"
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the homeserver deems the authentication attempt to be successful but still requires more stages to be completed, it returns HTTP status 401 along with the same object as when no authentication was attempted, with the addition of the =completed= key which is an array of auth types the client has completed successfully:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "completed": [ "example.type.foo" ],
  "flows": [
  {
  "stages": [ "example.type.foo", "example.type.bar" ]
  },
  {
  "stages": [ "example.type.foo", "example.type.baz" ]
  }
  ],
  "params": {
  "example.type.baz": {
  "example_key": "foobar"
  }
  },
  "session": "xxxxxx"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Individual stages may require more than one request to complete, in which case the response will be as if the request was unauthenticated with the addition of any other keys as defined by the auth type.

If the homeserver decides that an attempt on a stage was unsuccessful, but the client may make a second attempt, it returns the same HTTP status 401 response as above, with the addition of the standard =errcode= and =error= fields describing the error. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN",
  "error": "Invalid password",
  "completed": [ "example.type.foo" ],
  "flows": [
  {
  "stages": [ "example.type.foo", "example.type.bar" ]
  },
  {
  "stages": [ "example.type.foo", "example.type.baz" ]
  }
  ],
  "params": {
  "example.type.baz": {
  "example_key": "foobar"
  }
  },
  "session": "xxxxxx"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the request fails for a reason other than authentication, the server returns an error message in the standard format. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
  "errcode": "M_EXAMPLE_ERROR",
  "error": "Something was wrong"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the client has completed all stages of a flow, the homeserver performs the API call and returns the result as normal. Completed stages cannot be retried by clients, therefore servers must return either a 401 response with the completed stages, or the result of the API call if all stages were completed when a client retries a stage.

Some authentication types may be completed by means other than through the Matrix client, for example, an email confirmation may be completed when the user clicks on the link in the email. In this case, the client retries the request with an auth dict containing only the session key. The response to this will be the same as if the client were attempting to complete an auth state normally, i.e. the request will either complete or request auth, with the presence or absence of that auth type in the 'completed' array indicating whether that stage is complete.

| [[#id20][[1]]]   | A request to an endpoint that uses User-Interactive Authentication never succeeds without auth. Homeservers may allow requests that don't require auth by offering a stage with only the =m.login.dummy= auth type, but they must still give a 401 response to requests with no auth data.   |

  - =m.login.recaptcha=
  - =m.login.oauth2=
  - =m.login.sso=
  - =m.login.email.identity=
  - =m.login.msisdn=

| Type:          | =m.login.password=                                                               |
| Description:   | The client submits an identifier and secret password, both sent in plain-text.   |

To use this authentication type, clients should submit an auth dict as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.password",
  "identifier": {
  ...
  },
  "password": "<password>",
  "session": "<session ID>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

where the =identifier= property is a user identifier object, as described in [[#identifier-types][Identifier types]].

For example, to authenticate using the user's Matrix ID, clients would submit:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.password",
  "identifier": {
  "type": "m.id.user",
  "user": "<user_id or user localpart>"
  },
  "password": "<password>",
  "session": "<session ID>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively reply using a 3PID bound to the user's account on the homeserver using the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-account-3pid][=/account/3pid=]] API rather then giving the =user= explicitly as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.password",
  "identifier": {
  "type": "m.id.thirdparty",
  "medium": "<The medium of the third party identifier.>",
  "address": "<The third party address of the user>"
  },
  "password": "<password>",
  "session": "<session ID>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the case that the homeserver does not know about the supplied 3PID, the homeserver must respond with 403 Forbidden.

**** [[#id190][5.4.4.2   Google ReCaptcha]]

| Description:   | The user completes a Google ReCaptcha 2.0 challenge   |

To use this authentication type, clients should submit an auth dict as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.recaptcha",
  "response": "<captcha response>",
  "session": "<session ID>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** [[#id191][5.4.4.3   Token-based]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: token-based
:END:

| Type:          | =m.login.token=                     |
| Description:   | The client submits a login token.   |

To use this authentication type, clients should submit an auth dict as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.token",
  "token": "<token>",
  "txn_id": "<client generated nonce>",
  "session": "<session ID>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

A client may receive a login =token= via some external service, such as email or SMS. Note that a login token is separate from an access token, the latter providing general authentication to various API endpoints.

Additionally, the server must encode the user ID in the =token=; there is therefore no need for the client to submit a separate username.

The =txn_id= should be a random string generated by the client for the request. The same =txn_id= should be used if retrying the request. The =txn_id= may be used by the server to disallow other devices from using the token, thus providing "single use" tokens while still allowing the device to retry the request. This would be done by tying the token to the =txn_id= server side, as well as potentially invalidating the token completely once the device has successfully logged in (e.g. when we receive a request from the newly provisioned access\_token).

| Description:   | Authentication is supported via OAuth2 URLs. This login consists of multiple requests.               |
| Parameters:    | =uri=: Authorization Request URI OR service selection URI. Both contain an encoded =redirect URI=.   |

The homeserver acts as a 'confidential' client for the purposes of OAuth2. If the uri is a =service selection URI=, it MUST point to a webpage which prompts the user to choose which service to authorize with. On selection of a service, this MUST link through to an =Authorization Request URI=. If there is only one service which the homeserver accepts when logging in, this indirection can be skipped and the "uri" key can be the =Authorization Request URI=.

The client then visits the =Authorization Request URI=, which then shows the OAuth2 Allow/Deny prompt. Hitting 'Allow' redirects to the =redirect URI= with the auth code. Homeservers can choose any path for the =redirect URI=. Once the OAuth flow has completed, the client retries the request with the session only, as above.

| Description:   | Authentication is supported by authorising with an external single sign-on provider.   |

A client wanting to complete authentication using SSO should use the [[#fallback][Fallback]] authentication flow by opening a browser window for =/_matrix/client/r0/auth/m.login.sso/fallback/web?session=<...>= with the session parameter set to the session ID provided by the server.

The homeserver should return a page which asks for the user's confirmation before proceeding. For example, the page could say words to the effect of:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A client is trying to remove a device/add an email address/take over your account. To confirm this action, re-authenticate with single sign-on. If you did not expect this, your account may be compromised!
#+END_QUOTE

Once the user has confirmed they should be redirected to the single sign-on provider's login page. Once the provider has validated the user, the browser is redirected back to the homeserver.

The homeserver then validates the response from the single sign-on provider and updates the user-interactive authentication session to mark the single sign-on stage has been completed. The browser is shown the fallback authentication completion page.

Once the flow has completed, the client retries the request with the session only, as above.

| Description:   | Authentication is supported by authorising an email address with an identity server, or homeserver if supported.   |

Prior to submitting this, the client should authenticate with an identity server (or homeserver). After authenticating, the session information should be submitted to the homeserver.

To use this authentication type, clients should submit an auth dict as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  "threepidCreds": [
  {
  "sid": "<identity server session id>",
  "client_secret": "<identity server client secret>",

| Description:   | Dummy authentication always succeeds and requires no extra parameters. Its purpose is to allow servers to not require any form of User-Interactive Authentication to perform a request. It can also be used to differentiate flows where otherwise one flow would be a subset of another flow. eg. if a server offers flows =m.login.recaptcha= and =m.login.recaptcha,                                                             m.login.email.identity= and the client completes the recaptcha stage first, the auth would succeed with the former flow, even if the client was intending to then complete the email auth stage. A server can instead send flows =m.login.recaptcha, m.login.dummy= and =m.login.recaptcha,                                                             m.login.email.identity= to fix the ambiguity.   |

To use this authentication type, clients should submit an auth dict with just the type and session, if provided:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.dummy",
  "session": "<session ID>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** [[#id197][5.4.5   Fallback]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fallback
:END:

Clients cannot be expected to be able to know how to process every single login type. If a client does not know how to handle a given login type, it can direct the user to a web browser with the URL of a fallback page which will allow the user to complete that login step out-of-band in their web browser. The URL it should open is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  /_matrix/client/r0/auth/<auth type>/fallback/web?session=<session ID>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where =auth type= is the type name of the stage it is attempting and =session ID= is the ID of the session given by the homeserver.

This MUST return an HTML page which can perform this authentication stage. This page must use the following JavaScript when the authentication has been completed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  if (window.onAuthDone) {
  window.onAuthDone();
  } else if (window.opener && window.opener.postMessage) {
  window.opener.postMessage("authDone", "*");
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

This allows the client to either arrange for the global function =onAuthDone= to be defined in an embedded browser, or to use the HTML5 [[https://www.w3.org/TR/webmessaging/#web-messaging][cross-document messaging]] API, to receive a notification that the authentication stage has been completed.

Once a client receives the notificaton that the authentication stage has been completed, it should resubmit the request with an auth dict with just the session ID:

  "session": "<session ID>"

Some authentication mechanisms use a user identifier object to identify a user. The user identifier object has a =type= field to indicate the type of identifier being used, and depending on the type, has other fields giving the information required to identify the user as described below.

- This specification defines the following identifier types: :: 

  - =m.id.user=
  - =m.id.thirdparty=
  - =m.id.phone=

| Description:   | The user is identified by a third-party identifier in canonicalised form.   |

A client can identify a user using a 3PID associated with the user's account on the homeserver, where the 3PID was previously associated using the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-account-3pid][=/account/3pid=]] API. See the [[../appendices.html#pid-types][3PID Types]] Appendix for a list of Third-party ID media.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

| Description:   | The user is identified by a phone number.   |

A client can identify a user using a phone number associated with the user's account, where the phone number was previously associated using the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-account-3pid][=/account/3pid=]] API. The phone number can be passed in as entered by the user; the homeserver will be responsible for canonicalising it. If the client wishes to canonicalise the phone number, then it can use the =m.id.thirdparty= identifier type with a =medium= of =msisdn= instead.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  "identifier": {
  "type": "m.id.phone",
  "country": "<The country that the phone number is from>",
  "phone": "<The phone number>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =country= is the two-letter uppercase ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code that the number in =phone= should be parsed as if it were dialled from.

** [[#id203][5.5   Login]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: login
:END:

A client can obtain access tokens using the =/login= API.

Note that this endpoint does not currently use the user-interactive authentication API.

For a simple username/password login, clients should submit a =/login= request as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.password",
  "identifier": {
  "type": "m.id.user",
  "user": "<user_id or user localpart>"
  },
  "password": "<password>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively, a client can use a 3PID bound to the user's account on the homeserver using the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-account-3pid][=/account/3pid=]] API rather then giving the =user= explicitly, as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.password",
  "identifier": {
  "medium": "<The medium of the third party identifier>",
  "address": "<The canonicalised third party address of the user>"
  },
  "password": "<password>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the case that the homeserver does not know about the supplied 3PID, the homeserver must respond with =403 Forbidden=.

To log in using a login token, clients should submit a =/login= request as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.login.token",
  "token": "<login token>"

As with [[#token-based][token-based]] interactive login, the =token= must encode the user ID. In the case that the token is not valid, the homeserver must respond with =403 Forbidden= and an error code of =M_FORBIDDEN=.

If the homeserver advertises =m.login.sso= as a viable flow, and the client supports it, the client should redirect the user to the =/redirect= endpoint for [[#sso-client-login][Single Sign-On]]. After authentication is complete, the client will need to submit a =/login= request matching =m.login.token=.

:CUSTOM_ID: post-_matrixclientr0register
:END:

This API endpoint uses the [[#user-interactive-authentication-api][User-Interactive Authentication API]], except in the cases where a guest account is being registered.

Register for an account on this homeserver.

There are two kinds of user account:

- user accounts. These accounts may use the full API described in this specification.
- guest accounts. These accounts may have limited permissions and may not be supported by all servers.

If registration is successful, this endpoint will issue an access token the client can use to authorize itself in subsequent requests.

If the client does not supply a =device_id=, the server must auto-generate one.

The server SHOULD register an account with a User ID based on the =username= provided, if any. Note that the grammar of Matrix User ID localparts is restricted, so the server MUST either map the provided =username= onto a =user_id= in a logical manner, or reject =username=s which do not comply to the grammar, with =M_INVALID_USERNAME=.

Matrix clients MUST NOT assume that localpart of the registered =user_id= matches the provided =username=.

The returned access token must be associated with the =device_id= supplied by the client or generated by the server. The server may invalidate any access token previously associated with that device. See [[#relationship-between-access-tokens-and-devices][Relationship between access tokens and devices]].

When registering a guest account, all parameters in the request body with the exception of =initial_device_display_name= MUST BE ignored by the server. The server MUST pick a =device_id= for the account regardless of input.

Any user ID returned by this API must conform to the grammar given in the [[../appendices.html#user-identifiers][Matrix specification]].

Request format:

Parameter

Type

Description

/query parameters/

kind

enum

The kind of account to register. Defaults to =user=. One of: ["guest", "user"]

/JSON body parameters/

auth

Authentication Data

Additional authentication information for the user-interactive authentication API. Note that this information is /not/ used to define how the registered user should be authenticated, but is instead used to authenticate the =register= call itself.

username

string

The basis for the localpart of the desired Matrix ID. If omitted, the homeserver MUST generate a Matrix ID local part.

password

string

The desired password for the account.

device\_id

string

ID of the client device. If this does not correspond to a known client device, a new device will be created. The server will auto-generate a device\_id if this is not specified.

initial\_device\_display\_name

string

A display name to assign to the newly-created device. Ignored if =device_id= corresponds to a known device.

inhibit\_login

boolean

If true, an =access_token= and =device_id= should not be returned from this call, therefore preventing an automatic login. Defaults to false.

*Status code 400:*

Part of the request was invalid. This may include one of the following error codes:

- =M_USER_IN_USE= : The desired user ID is already taken.
- =M_INVALID_USERNAME= : The desired user ID is not a valid user name.
- =M_EXCLUSIVE= : The desired user ID is in the exclusive namespace claimed by an application service.

These errors may be returned at any stage of the registration process, including after authentication if the requested user ID was registered whilst the client was performing authentication.

Homeservers MUST perform the relevant checks and return these codes before performing User-Interactive Authentication, although they may also return them after authentication is completed if, for example, the requested user ID was registered whilst the client was performing authentication.

Example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "M_USER_IN_USE",
  "error": "Desired user ID is already taken."
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Status code 401:*

The homeserver requires additional authentication information.

*Status code 403:*

The homeserver does not permit registering the account. This response can be used to identify that a particular =kind= of account is not allowed, or that registration is generally not supported by the homeserver.

*Required.* The server will only send an email if the =send_attempt= is a number greater than the most recent one which it has seen, scoped to that =email= + =client_secret= pair. This is to avoid repeatedly sending the same email in the case of request retries between the POSTing user and the identity server. The client should increment this value if they desire a new email (e.g. a reminder) to be sent. If they do not, the server should respond with success but not resend the email.

next\_link

string

Optional. When the validation is completed, the identity server will redirect the user to this URL. This option is ignored when submitting 3PID validation information through a POST request.

id\_server

string

The hostname of the identity server to communicate with. May optionally include a port. This parameter is ignored when the homeserver handles 3PID verification.

This parameter is deprecated with a plan to be removed in a future specification version for =/account/password= and =/register= requests.

id\_access\_token

string

An access token previously registered with the identity server. Servers can treat this as optional to distinguish between r0.5-compatible clients and this specification version.

Required if an =id_server= is supplied.

Changes the password for an account on this homeserver.

This API endpoint uses the [[#user-interactive-authentication-api][User-Interactive Authentication API]] to ensure the user changing the password is actually the owner of the account.

An access token should be submitted to this endpoint if the client has an active session.

The homeserver may change the flows available depending on whether a valid access token is provided. The homeserver SHOULD NOT revoke the access token provided in the request. Whether other access tokens for the user are revoked depends on the request parameters.

This API's parameters and response are identical to that of the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-register-email-requesttoken][=/register/msisdn/requestToken=]] endpoint, except that =M_THREEPID_NOT_FOUND= may be returned if no account matching the given phone number could be found. The server may instead send the SMS to the given phone number prompting the user to create an account. =M_THREEPID_IN_USE= may not be returned.

The homeserver should validate the phone number itself, either by sending a validation message itself or by using a service it has control over.

Request format:

Parameter

Type

Description

/JSON body parameters/

client\_secret

string

*Required.* A unique string generated by the client, and used to identify the validation attempt. It must be a string consisting of the characters =[0-9a-zA-Z.=_-]=. Its length must not exceed 255 characters and it must not be empty.

country

string

*Required.* The two-letter uppercase ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code that the number in =phone_number= should be parsed as if it were dialled from.

phone\_number

string

*Required.* The phone number to validate.

send\_attempt

integer

*Required.* The server will only send an SMS if the =send_attempt= is a number greater than the most recent one which it has seen, scoped to that =country= + =phone_number= + =client_secret= triple. This is to avoid repeatedly sending the same SMS in the case of request retries between the POSTing user and the identity server. The client should increment this value if they desire a new SMS (e.g. a reminder) to be sent.

next\_link

string

Optional. When the validation is completed, the identity server will redirect the user to this URL. This option is ignored when submitting 3PID validation information through a POST request.

:END:

Deactivate the user's account, removing all ability for the user to login again.

This API endpoint uses the [[#user-interactive-authentication-api][User-Interactive Authentication API]].

An access token should be submitted to this endpoint if the client has an active session.

The homeserver may change the flows available depending on whether a valid access token is provided.

Unlike other endpoints, this endpoint does not take an =id_access_token= parameter because the homeserver is expected to sign the request to the identity server instead.

Checks to see if a username is available, and valid, for the server.

The server should check to ensure that, at the time of the request, the username requested is available for use. This includes verifying that an application service has not claimed the username and that the username fits the server's desired requirements (for example, a server could dictate that it does not permit usernames with underscores).

Matrix clients may wish to use this API prior to attempting registration, however the clients must also be aware that using this API does not normally reserve the username. This can mean that the username becomes unavailable between checking its availability and attempting to register it.

A homeserver may keep some contact information for administrative use. This is independent of any information kept by any identity servers, though can be proxied (bound) to the identity server in many cases.

Note

This section deals with two terms: "add" and "bind". Where "add" (or "remove") is used, it is speaking about an identifier that was not bound to an identity server. As a result, "bind" (or "unbind") references an identifier that is found in an identity server. Note that an identifer can be added and bound at the same time, depending on context.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: post-_matrixclientr0account3pidemailrequesttoken
:END:

The homeserver must check that the given email address is *not* already associated with an account on this homeserver. This API should be used to request validation tokens when adding an email address to an account. This API's parameters and response are identical to that of the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-register-email-requesttoken][=/register/email/requestToken=]] endpoint. The homeserver should validate the email itself, either by sending a validation email itself or by using a service it has control over.

| Rate-limited:    | No.   |
| Requires auth:   | No.   |

Request format:

Parameter

Type

Description

/JSON body parameters/

client\_secret

string

*Required.* A unique string generated by the client, and used to identify the validation attempt. It must be a string consisting of the characters =[0-9a-zA-Z.=_-]=. Its length must not exceed 255 characters and it must not be empty.

email

string

*Required.* The email address to validate.

send\_attempt

integer

*Required.* The server will only send an email if the =send_attempt= is a number greater than the most recent one which it has seen, scoped to that =email= + =client_secret= pair. This is to avoid repeatedly sending the same email in the case of request retries between the POSTing user and the identity server. The client should increment this value if they desire a new email (e.g. a reminder) to be sent. If they do not, the server should respond with success but not resend the email.

next\_link

string

Optional. When the validation is completed, the identity server will redirect the user to this URL. This option is ignored when submitting 3PID validation information through a POST request.

id\_server

string

The hostname of the identity server to communicate with. May optionally include a port. This parameter is ignored when the homeserver handles 3PID verification.

This parameter is deprecated with a plan to be removed in a future specification version for =/account/password= and =/register= requests.

id\_access\_token

string

An access token previously registered with the identity server. Servers can treat this as optional to distinguish between r0.5-compatible clients and this specification version.

Required if an =id_server= is supplied.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: notes-on-identity-servers
:END:

Identity servers in Matrix store bindings (relationships) between a user's third party identifier, typically email or phone number, and their user ID. Once a user has chosen an identity server, that identity server should be used by all clients.

Clients can see which identity server the user has chosen through the =m.identity_server= account data event, as described below. Clients SHOULD refrain from making requests to any identity server until the presence of =m.identity_server= is confirmed as (not) present. If present, the client SHOULD check for the presence of the =base_url= property in the event's content. If the =base_url= is present, the client SHOULD use the identity server in that property as the identity server for the user. If the =base_url= is missing, or the account data event is not present, the client SHOULD use whichever default value it normally would for an identity server, if applicable. Clients SHOULD NOT update the account data with the default identity server when the user is missing an identity server in their account data.

Clients SHOULD listen for changes to the =m.identity_server= account data event and update the identity server they are contacting as a result.

If the client offers a way to set the identity server to use, it MUST update the value of =m.identity_server= accordingly. A =base_url= of =null= MUST be treated as though the user does not want to use an identity server, disabling all related functionality as a result.

Clients SHOULD refrain from populating the account data as a migration step for users who are lacking the account data, unless the user sets the identity server within the client to a value. For example, a user which has no =m.identity_server= account data event should not end up with the client's default identity server in their account data, unless the user first visits their account settings to set the identity server.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: capabilities-negotiation
:END:

A homeserver may not support certain operations and clients must be able to query for what the homeserver can and can't offer. For example, a homeserver may not support users changing their password as it is configured to perform authentication against an external system.

The capabilities advertised through this system are intended to advertise functionality which is optional in the API, or which depend in some way on the state of the user or server. This system should not be used to advertise unstable or experimental features - this is better done by the =/versions= endpoint.

Some examples of what a reasonable capability could be are:

- Whether the server supports user presence.
- Whether the server supports optional features, such as the user or room directories.
- The rate limits or file type restrictions imposed on clients by the server.

Some examples of what should *not* be a capability are:

- Whether the server supports a feature in the =unstable= specification.
- Media size limits - these are handled by the =/media/r0/config= API.
- Optional encodings or alternative transports for communicating with the server.

Capabilities prefixed with =m.= are reserved for definition in the Matrix specification while other values may be used by servers using the Java package naming convention. The capabilities supported by the Matrix specification are defined later in this section.

** [[#id234][6.2   =m.change_password= capability]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.change_password-capability
:END:

This capability has a single flag, =enabled=, which indicates whether or not the user can use the =/account/password= API to change their password. If not present, the client should assume that password changes are possible via the API. When present, clients SHOULD respect the capability's =enabled= flag and indicate to the user if they are unable to change their password.

An example of the capability API's response for this capability is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "capabilities": {
  "m.change_password": {
  "enabled": false
  }
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

** [[#id235][6.3   =m.room_versions= capability]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.room_versions-capability
:END:

This capability describes the default and available room versions a server supports, and at what level of stability. Clients should make use of this capability to determine if users need to be encouraged to upgrade their rooms.

An example of the capability API's response for this capability is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "capabilities": {
  "m.room_versions": {
  "default": "1",
  "available": {
  "1": "stable",
  "2": "stable",
  "3": "unstable",
  "custom-version": "unstable"
  }
  }
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

This capability mirrors the same restrictions of [[../index.html#room-versions][room versions]] to describe which versions are stable and unstable. Clients should assume that the =default= version is =stable=. Any version not explicitly labelled as =stable= in the =available= versions is to be treated as =unstable=. For example, a version listed as =future-stable= should be treated as =unstable=.

The =default= version is the version the server is using to create new rooms. Clients should encourage users with sufficient permissions in a room to upgrade their room to the =default= version when the room is using an =unstable= version.

When this capability is not listed, clients should use ="1"= as the default and only stable =available= room version.

* [[#id236][7   Pagination]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pagination
:END:

Note

The paths referred to in this section are not actual endpoints. They only serve as examples to explain how pagination functions.

Pagination is the process of dividing a dataset into multiple discrete pages. Matrix makes use of pagination to allow clients to view extremely large datasets. These datasets are not limited to events in a room (for example clients may want to paginate a list of rooms in addition to events within those rooms). Regardless of what is being paginated, there is a common approach which is used to give clients an easy way of selecting subsets of a potentially changing dataset. Each endpoint that uses pagination may use different parameters. However the theme among them is that they take a =from= and =to= token, and occasionally a =limit= and =dir=. Together, these parameters describe the position in a data set, where =from= and =to= are known as "stream tokens" matching the regular expression =[a-zA-Z0-9.=_-]+=. If supported, the =dir= defines the direction of events to return: either forwards (=f=) or backwards (=b=). The response may contain tokens that can be used for retrieving results before or after the returned set. These tokens may be called start or prev\_batch for retrieving the previous result set, or end, next\_batch or next\_token for retrieving the next result set.

In the following examples, 'START' and 'END' are placeholders to signify the start and end of the data sets respectively.

For example, if an endpoint had events E1 -> E15. The client wants the last 5 events and doesn't know any previous events:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  S E
  |-E1-E2-E3-E4-E5-E6-E7-E8-E9-E10-E11-E12-E13-E14-E15-|
  | | |
  | _____| <--backwards-- |
  |__________________ | | ________|
  | | | |
  GET /somepath?to=START&limit=5&dir=b&from=END
  Returns:
  E15,E14,E13,E12,E11
#+END_EXAMPLE

Another example: a public room list has rooms R1 -> R17. The client is showing 5 rooms at a time on screen, and is on page 2. They want to now show page 3 (rooms R11 -> 15):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  S E
  | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 | stream token
  |-R1-R2-R3-R4-R5-R6-R7-R8-R9-R10-R11-R12-R13-R14-R15-R16-R17| room
  |____________| |________________|
  | |
  Currently |
  viewing |
  |
  GET /roomslist?from=9&to=END&limit=5
  Returns: R11,R12,R13,R14,R15
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that tokens are treated in an /exclusive/, not inclusive, manner. The end token from the initial request was '9' which corresponded to R10. When the 2nd request was made, R10 did not appear again, even though from=9 was specified. If you know the token, you already have the data.

Responses for pagination-capable endpoints SHOULD have a =chunk= array alongside the applicable stream tokens to represent the result set.

In general, when the end of a result set is reached the applicable stream token will be excluded from the response. For example, if a user was backwards-paginating events in a room they'd eventually reach the first event in the room. In this scenario, the =prev_batch= token would be excluded from the response. Some paginated endpoints are open-ended in one direction, such as endpoints which expose an event stream for an active room. In this case, it is not possible for the client to reach the true "end" of the data set and therefore should always be presented with a token to keep moving forwards.

* [[#id237][8   Filtering]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: filtering
:END:

Filters can be created on the server and can be passed as a parameter to APIs which return events. These filters alter the data returned from those APIs. Not all APIs accept filters.

** [[#id238][8.1   Lazy-loading room members]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lazy-loading-room-members
:END:

Membership events often take significant resources for clients to track. In an effort to reduce the number of resources used, clients can enable "lazy-loading" for room members. By doing this, servers will attempt to only send membership events which are relevant to the client.

It is important to understand that lazy-loading is not intended to be a perfect optimisation, and that it may not be practical for the server to calculate precisely which membership events are relevant to the client. As a result, it is valid for the server to send redundant membership events to the client to ease implementation, although such redundancy should be minimised where possible to conserve bandwidth.

In terms of filters, lazy-loading is enabled by enabling =lazy_load_members= on a =RoomEventFilter= (or a =StateFilter= in the case of =/sync= only). When enabled, lazy-loading aware endpoints (see below) will only include membership events for the =sender= of events being included in the response. For example, if a client makes a =/sync= request with lazy-loading enabled, the server will only return membership events for the =sender= of events in the timeline, not all members of a room.

When processing a sequence of events (e.g. by looping on =/sync= or paginating =/messages=), it is common for blocks of events in the sequence to share a similar set of senders. Rather than responses in the sequence sending duplicate membership events for these senders to the client, the server MAY assume that clients will remember membership events they have already been sent, and choose to skip sending membership events for members whose membership has not changed. These are called 'redundant membership events'. Clients may request that redundant membership events are always included in responses by setting =include_redundant_members= to true in the filter.

The expected pattern for using lazy-loading is currently:

- Client performs an initial /sync with lazy-loading enabled, and receives only the membership events which relate to the senders of the events it receives.
- Clients which support display-name tab-completion or other operations which require rapid access to all members in a room should call /members for the currently selected room, with an =?at= parameter set to the /sync response's from token. The member list for the room is then maintained by the state in subsequent incremental /sync responses.
- Clients which do not support tab-completion may instead pull in profiles for arbitrary users (e.g. read receipts, typing notifications) on demand by querying the room state or =/profile=.

The current endpoints which support lazy-loading room members are:

- [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]]
- [[#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages][=/rooms/<room_id>/messages=]]
- [[#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-context-eventid][=/rooms/{roomId}/context/{eventId}=]]

* [[#id242][9   Events]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: events
:END:

The model of conversation history exposed by the client-server API can be considered as a list of events. The server 'linearises' the eventually-consistent event graph of events into an 'event stream' at any given point in time:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [E0]->[E1]->[E2]->[E3]->[E4]->[E5]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Warning

The format of events can change depending on room version. Check the [[../index.html#room-versions][room version specification]] for specific details on what to expect for event formats. Examples contained within the client-server specification are expected to be compatible with all specified room versions, however some differences may still apply.

For this version of the specification, clients only need to worry about the event ID format being different depending on room version. Clients should not be parsing the event ID, and instead be treating it as an opaque string. No changes should be required to support the currently available room versions.

** [[#id243][9.1   Types of room events]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: types-of-room-events
:END:

Room events are split into two categories:

| State Events:     | These are events which update the metadata state of the room (e.g. room topic, room membership etc). State is keyed by a tuple of event =type= and a =state_key=. State in the room with the same key-tuple will be overwritten.   |
| Message events:   | These are events which describe transient "once-off" activity in a room: typically communication such as sending an instant message or setting up a VoIP call.                                                                     |

This specification outlines several events, all with the event type prefix =m.=. (See [[#room-events][Room Events]] for the m. event specification.) However, applications may wish to add their own type of event, and this can be achieved using the REST API detailed in the following sections. If new events are added, the event =type= key SHOULD follow the Java package naming convention, e.g. =com.example.myapp.event=. This ensures event types are suitably namespaced for each application and reduces the risk of clashes.

Note

Events are not limited to the types defined in this specification. New or custom event types can be created on a whim using the Java package naming convention. For example, a =com.example.game.score= event can be sent by clients and other clients would receive it through Matrix, assuming the client has access to the =com.example= namespace.

Note that the structure of these events may be different than those in the server-server API.

In addition to the fields of a Room Event, State Events have the following fields.

| Key             | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| state\_key      | string         | *Required.* A unique key which defines the overwriting semantics for this piece of room state. This value is often a zero-length string. The presence of this key makes this event a State Event. State keys starting with an =@= are reserved for referencing user IDs, such as room members. With the exception of a few events, state events set with a given user's ID as the state key MUST only be set by that user.   |
| prev\_content   | EventContent   | Optional. The previous =content= for this event. If there is no previous content, this key will be missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

** [[#id247][9.2   Size limits]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: size-limits
:END:

The complete event MUST NOT be larger than 65535 bytes, when formatted as a [[../server_server/r0.1.4#pdus][PDU for the Server-Server protocol]], including any signatures, and encoded as [[../appendices.html#canonical-json][Canonical JSON]].

There are additional restrictions on sizes per key:

- =sender= MUST NOT exceed 255 bytes (including domain).
- =room_id= MUST NOT exceed 255 bytes.
- =state_key= MUST NOT exceed 255 bytes.
- =type= MUST NOT exceed 255 bytes.
- =event_id= MUST NOT exceed 255 bytes.

Some event types have additional size restrictions which are specified in the description of the event. Additional keys have no limit other than that implied by the total 65 KB limit on events.

- /State Event/ :: =state_key=: A zero-length string.

This event is used to inform the room about which alias should be considered the canonical one, and which other aliases point to the room. This could be for display purposes or as suggestion to users which alias to use to advertise and access the room.

- /State Event/ :: =state_key=: A zero-length string.

A room may be =public= meaning anyone can join the room without any prior action. Alternatively, it can be =invite= meaning that a user who wishes to join the room must first receive an invite to the room from someone already inside of the room. Currently, =knock= and =private= are reserved keywords which are not implemented.

| Content Key   | Type   | Description                                                                                                                |

*** [[#id252][9.3.4   =m.room.member=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.room.member
:END:

- /State Event/ :: =state_key=: The =user_id= this membership event relates to. In all cases except for when =membership= is =join=, the user ID sending the event does not need to match the user ID in the =state_key=, unlike other events. Regular authorisation rules still apply.

Adjusts the membership state for a user in a room. It is preferable to use the membership APIs (=/rooms/<room id>/invite= etc) when performing membership actions rather than adjusting the state directly as there are a restricted set of valid transformations. For example, user A cannot force user B to join a room, and trying to force this state change directly will fail.

The following membership states are specified:

- =invite= - The user has been invited to join a room, but has not yet joined it. They may not participate in the room until they join.
- =join= - The user has joined the room (possibly after accepting an invite), and may participate in it.
- =leave= - The user was once joined to the room, but has since left (possibly by choice, or possibly by being kicked).
- =ban= - The user has been banned from the room, and is no longer allowed to join it until they are un-banned from the room (by having their membership state set to a value other than =ban=).
- =knock= - This is a reserved word, which currently has no meaning.

The =third_party_invite= property will be set if this invite is an =invite= event and is the successor of an =m.room.third_party_invite= event, and absent otherwise.

This event may also include an =invite_room_state= key inside the event's =unsigned= data. If present, this contains an array of =StrippedState= Events. These events provide information on a subset of state events such as the room name.

The user for which a membership applies is represented by the =state_key=. Under some conditions, the =sender= and =state_key= may not match - this may be interpreted as the =sender= affecting the membership state of the =state_key= user.

The =membership= for a given user can change over time. The table below represents the various changes over time and how clients and servers must interpret those changes. Previous membership can be retrieved from the =prev_content= object on an event. If not present, the user's previous membership must be assumed as =leave=.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.room.power_levels
:END:

- /State Event/ :: =state_key=: A zero-length string.

This event specifies the minimum level a user must have in order to perform a certain action. It also specifies the levels of each user in the room.

If a =user_id= is in the =users= list, then that =user_id= has the associated power level. Otherwise they have the default level =users_default=. If =users_default= is not supplied, it is assumed to be 0. If the room contains no =m.room.power_levels= event, the room's creator has a power level of 100, and all other users have a power level of 0.

The level required to send a certain event is governed by =events=, =state_default= and =events_default=. If an event type is specified in =events=, then the user must have at least the level specified in order to send that event. If the event type is not supplied, it defaults to =events_default= for Message Events and =state_default= for State Events.

If there is no =state_default= in the =m.room.power_levels= event, the =state_default= is 50. If there is no =events_default= in the =m.room.power_levels= event, the =events_default= is 0. If the room contains no =m.room.power_levels= event, /both/ the =state_default= and =events_default= are 0.

The power level required to invite a user to the room, kick a user from the room, ban a user from the room, or redact an event, is defined by =invite=, =kick=, =ban=, and =redact=, respectively. Each of these levels defaults to 50 if they are not specified in the =m.room.power_levels= event, or if the room contains no =m.room.power_levels= event.

Note

As noted above, in the absence of an =m.room.power_levels= event, the =state_default= is 0, and all users are considered to have power level 0. That means that *any* member of the room can send an =m.room.power_levels= event, changing the permissions in the room.

Server implementations should therefore ensure that each room has an =m.room.power_levels= event as soon as it is created. See also the documentation of the =/createRoom= API.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.room.redaction
:END:

/Message Event/

Events can be redacted by either room or server admins. Redacting an event means that all keys not required by the protocol are stripped off, allowing admins to remove offensive or illegal content that may have been attached to any event. This cannot be undone, allowing server owners to physically delete the offending data. There is also a concept of a moderator hiding a message event, which can be undone, but cannot be applied to state events. The event that has been redacted is specified in the =redacts= event level key.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: historical-events
:END:

Some events within the =m.= namespace might appear in rooms, however they serve no significant meaning in this version of the specification. They are:

- =m.room.aliases=

Previous versions of the specification have more information on these events.

** [[#id256][9.4   Syncing]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: syncing
:END:

To read events, the intended flow of operation is for clients to first call the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] API without a =since= parameter. This returns the most recent message events for each room, as well as the state of the room at the start of the returned timeline. The response also includes a =next_batch= field, which should be used as the value of the =since= parameter in the next call to =/sync=. Finally, the response includes, for each room, a =prev_batch= field, which can be passed as a =start= parameter to the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages][=/rooms/<room_id>/messages=]] API to retrieve earlier messages.

You can visualise the range of events being returned as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [E0]->[E1]->[E2]->[E3]->[E4]->[E5]
  ^ ^
  | |
  prev_batch: '1-2-3' next_batch: 'a-b-c'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Clients then receive new events by "long-polling" the homeserver via the =/sync= API, passing the value of the =next_batch= field from the response to the previous call as the =since= parameter. The client should also pass a =timeout= parameter. The server will then hold open the HTTP connection for a short period of time waiting for new events, returning early if an event occurs. Only the =/sync= API (and the deprecated =/events= API) support long-polling in this way.

The response for such an incremental sync can be visualised as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [E0]->[E1]->[E2]->[E3]->[E4]->[E5]->[E6]
  ^ ^
  | |
  | next_batch: 'x-y-z'
  prev_batch: 'a-b-c'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Normally, all new events which are visible to the client will appear in the response to the =/sync= API. However, if a large number of events arrive between calls to =/sync=, a "limited" timeline is returned, containing only the most recent message events. A state "delta" is also returned, summarising any state changes in the omitted part of the timeline. The client may therefore end up with "gaps" in its knowledge of the message timeline. The client can fill these gaps using the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages][=/rooms/<room_id>/messages=]] API. This situation looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  | gap |
  | <-> |
  [E0]->[E1]->[E2]->[E3]->[E4]->[E5]->[E6]->[E7]->[E8]->[E9]->[E10]
  ^ ^
  | |
  prev_batch: 'd-e-f' next_batch: 'u-v-w'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Warning

Events are ordered in this API according to the arrival time of the event on the homeserver. This can conflict with other APIs which order events based on their partial ordering in the event graph. This can result in duplicate events being received (once per distinct API called). Clients SHOULD de-duplicate events based on the event ID when this happens.

Note

The =/sync= API returns a =state= list which is separate from the =timeline=. This =state= list allows clients to keep their model of the room state in sync with that on the server. In the case of an initial (=since=-less) sync, the =state= list represents the complete state of the room at the *start* of the returned timeline (so in the case of a recently-created room whose state fits entirely in the =timeline=, the =state= list will be empty).

In the case of an incremental sync, the =state= list gives a delta between the state of the room at the =since= parameter and that at the start of the returned =timeline=. (It will therefore be empty unless the timeline was =limited=.)

In both cases, it should be noted that the events returned in the =state= list did *not* necessarily take place just before the returned =timeline=, so clients should not display them to the user in the timeline.

Rationale

An early design of this specification made the =state= list represent the room state at the end of the returned timeline, instead of the start. This was unsatisfactory because it led to duplication of events between the =state= list and the =timeline=, but more importantly, it made it difficult for clients to show the timeline correctly.

In particular, consider a returned timeline [M0, S1, M2], where M0 and M2 are both messages sent by the same user, and S1 is a state event where that user changes their displayname. If the =state= list represents the room state at the end of the timeline, the client must take a copy of the state dictionary, and /rewind/ S1, in order to correctly calculate the display name for M0.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: get-_matrixclientr0sync
:END:

Synchronise the client's state with the latest state on the server. Clients use this API when they first log in to get an initial snapshot of the state on the server, and then continue to call this API to get incremental deltas to the state, and to receive new messages.

/Note/: This endpoint supports lazy-loading. See [[#filtering][Filtering]] for more information. Lazy-loading members is only supported on a =StateFilter= for this endpoint. When lazy-loading is enabled, servers MUST include the syncing user's own membership event when they join a room, or when the full state of rooms is requested, to aid discovering the user's avatar & displayname.

Like other members, the user's own membership event is eligible for being considered redundant by the server. When a sync is =limited=, the server MUST return membership events for events in the gap (between =since= and the start of the returned timeline), regardless as to whether or not they are redundant. This ensures that joins/leaves and profile changes which occur during the gap are not lost.

Request format:

Parameter

Type

Description

/query parameters/

filter

string

The ID of a filter created using the filter API or a filter JSON object encoded as a string. The server will detect whether it is an ID or a JSON object by whether the first character is a ="{"= open brace. Passing the JSON inline is best suited to one off requests. Creating a filter using the filter API is recommended for clients that reuse the same filter multiple times, for example in long poll requests.

See [[#filtering][Filtering]] for more information.

since

string

A point in time to continue a sync from.

full\_state

boolean

Controls whether to include the full state for all rooms the user is a member of.

If this is set to =true=, then all state events will be returned, even if =since= is non-empty. The timeline will still be limited by the =since= parameter. In this case, the =timeout= parameter will be ignored and the query will return immediately, possibly with an empty timeline.

If =false=, and =since= is non-empty, only state which has changed since the point indicated by =since= will be returned.

By default, this is =false=.

set\_presence

enum

Controls whether the client is automatically marked as online by polling this API. If this parameter is omitted then the client is automatically marked as online when it uses this API. Otherwise if the parameter is set to "offline" then the client is not marked as being online when it uses this API. When set to "unavailable", the client is marked as being idle. One of: ["offline", "online", "unavailable"]

timeout

integer

The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, before returning this request. If no events (or other data) become available before this time elapses, the server will return a response with empty fields.

By default, this is =0=, so the server will return immediately even if the response is empty.

| invite\_state   | InviteState   | The state of a room that the user has been invited to. These state events may only have the =sender=, =type=, =state_key= and =content= keys present.

Instead the client should keep two separate copies of the state: the one from the =invite_state= and one from the archived =state=. If the client joins the room then the current state will be given as a delta against the archived =state= not the =invite_state=.   |

Warning

This API is deprecated and will be removed from a future release.

This will listen for new events and return them to the caller. This will block until an event is received, or until the =timeout= is reached.

This endpoint was deprecated in r0 of this specification. Clients should instead call the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] API with a =since= parameter. See the [[https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server-migrating-from-v1.html#deprecated-endpoints][migration guide]].

| Rate-limited:    | No.    |
| Requires auth:   | Yes.   |

Request format:

Parameter

Type

Description

/query parameters/

from

string

The token to stream from. This token is either from a previous request to this API or from the initial sync API.

timeout

integer

The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for an event.

Warning

This API is deprecated and will be removed from a future release.

This returns the full state for this user, with an optional limit on the number of messages per room to return.

This endpoint was deprecated in r0 of this specification. Clients should instead call the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] API with no =since= parameter. See the [[https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server-migrating-from-v1.html#deprecated-endpoints][migration guide]].

| Rate-limited:    | No.    |
| Requires auth:   | Yes.   |

Request format:

Parameter

Type

integer

The maximum number of messages to return for each room.

archived

boolean

Whether to include rooms that the user has left. If =false= then only rooms that the user has been invited to or has joined are included. If set to =true= then rooms that the user has left are included as well. By default this is =false=.

State events can be sent using this endpoint. These events will be overwritten if =<room id>=, =<event type>= and =<state key>= all match.

Requests to this endpoint *cannot use transaction IDs* like other =PUT= paths because they cannot be differentiated from the =state_key=. Furthermore, =POST= is unsupported on state paths.

The body of the request should be the content object of the event; the fields in this object will vary depending on the type of event. See [[#room-events][Room Events]] for the =m.= event specification.

If the event type being sent is =m.room.canonical_alias= servers SHOULD ensure that any new aliases being listed in the event are valid per their grammar/syntax and that they point to the room ID where the state event is to be sent. Servers do not validate aliases which are being removed or are already present in the state event.

  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Status code 400:*

The sender's request is malformed.

Some example error codes include:

- =M_INVALID_PARAMETER=: One or more aliases within the =m.room.canonical_alias= event have invalid syntax.
- =M_BAD_ALIAS=: One or more aliases within the =m.room.canonical_alias= event do not point to the room ID for which the state event is to be sent to.

Example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "M_BAD_ALIAS",
  "error": "The alias '#hello:example.org' does not point to this room."
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Status code 403:*

The sender doesn't have permission to send the event into the room.

Example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN",
  "error": "You do not have permission to send the event."
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Examples*

Valid requests look like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  PUT /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.example.event
  { "key" : "without a state key" }

  PUT /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.another.example.event/foo
  { "key" : "with 'foo' as the state key" }
#+END_EXAMPLE

In contrast, these requests are invalid:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  POST /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.example.event/
  { "key" : "cannot use POST here" }

  PUT /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.another.example.event/foo/11
  { "key" : "txnIds are not supported" }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Care should be taken to avoid setting the wrong =state key=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  PUT /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.another.example.event/11
  { "key" : "with '11' as the state key, but was probably intended to be a txnId" }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =state_key= is often used to store state about individual users, by using the user ID as the =state_key= value. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  PUT /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.favorite.animal.event/%40my_user%3Aexample.org
  { "animal" : "cat", "reason": "fluffy" }
#+END_EXAMPLE

In some cases, there may be no need for a =state_key=, so it can be omitted:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  PUT /rooms/!roomid:domain/state/m.room.bgd.color
  { "color": "red", "hex": "#ff0000" }

** [[#id272][9.7   Redactions]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: redactions
:END:

Since events are extensible it is possible for malicious users and/or servers to add keys that are, for example offensive or illegal. Since some events cannot be simply deleted, e.g. membership events, we instead 'redact' events. This involves removing all keys from an event that are not required by the protocol. This stripped down event is thereafter returned anytime a client or remote server requests it. Redacting an event cannot be undone, allowing server owners to delete the offending content from the databases. Events that have been redacted include a =redacted_because= key whose value is the event that caused it to be redacted, which may include a reason.

The exact algorithm to apply against an event is defined in the [[../index.html#room-versions][room version specification]].

The server should add the event causing the redaction to the =unsigned= property of the redacted event, under the =redacted_because= key. When a client receives a redaction event it should change the redacted event in the same way a server does.

Note

Redacted events can still affect the state of the room. When redacted, state events behave as though their properties were simply not specified, except those protected by the redaction algorithm. For example, a redacted =join= event will still result in the user being considered joined. Similarly, a redacted topic does not necessarily cause the topic to revert to what is was prior to the event - it causes the topic to be removed from the room.

/Message Event/

Events can be redacted by either room or server admins. Redacting an event means that all keys not required by the protocol are stripped off, allowing admins to remove offensive or illegal content that may have been attached to any event. This cannot be undone, allowing server owners to physically delete the offending data. There is also a concept of a moderator hiding a message event, which can be undone, but cannot be applied to state events. The event that has been redacted is specified in the =redacts= event level key.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: creation
:END:

The homeserver will create an =m.room.create= event when a room is created, which serves as the root of the event graph for this room. This event also has a =creator= key which contains the user ID of the room creator. It will also generate several other events in order to manage permissions in this room. This includes:

- - =m.room.power_levels= : Sets the power levels of users and required power :: levels for various actions within the room such as sending events.

- =m.room.join_rules= : Whether the room is "invite-only" or not.

See [[#room-events][Room Events]] for more information on these events. To create a room, a client has to use the following API.

*** [[#id279][10.1.1   =POST /_matrix/client/r0/createRoom=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: post-_matrixclientr0createroom
:END:

Create a new room with various configuration options.

The server MUST apply the normal state resolution rules when creating the new room, including checking power levels for each event. It MUST apply the events implied by the request in the following order:

1. The =m.room.create= event itself. Must be the first event in the room.
2. An =m.room.member= event for the creator to join the room. This is needed so the remaining events can be sent.
3. A default =m.room.power_levels= event, giving the room creator (and not other members) permission to send state events. Overridden by the =power_level_content_override= parameter.
4. Events set by the =preset=. Currently these are the =m.room.join_rules=, =m.room.history_visibility=, and =m.room.guest_access= state events.
5. Events listed in =initial_state=, in the order that they are listed.
6. Events implied by =name= and =topic= (=m.room.name= and =m.room.topic= state events).
7. Invite events implied by =invite= and =invite_3pid= (=m.room.member= with =membership: invite= and =m.room.third_party_invite=).

The available presets do the following with respect to room state:

| Preset                   | =join_rules=   | =history_visibility=   | =guest_access=   | Other                                                              |

| Rate-limited:    | No.    |
| Requires auth:   | Yes.   |

Request format:

Parameter

Type

Description

/JSON body parameters/

visibility

enum

A =public= visibility indicates that the room will be shown in the published room list. A =private= visibility will hide the room from the published room list. Rooms default to =private= visibility if this key is not included. NB: This should not be confused with =join_rules= which also uses the word =public=. One of: ["public", "private"]

room\_alias\_name

string

The desired room alias *local part*. If this is included, a room alias will be created and mapped to the newly created room. The alias will belong on the /same/ homeserver which created the room. For example, if this was set to "foo" and sent to the homeserver "example.com" the complete room alias would be =#foo:example.com=.

The complete room alias will become the canonical alias for the room.

name

string

If this is included, an =m.room.name= event will be sent into the room to indicate the name of the room. See Room Events for more information on =m.room.name=.

topic

string

If this is included, an =m.room.topic= event will be sent into the room to indicate the topic for the room. See Room Events for more information on =m.room.topic=.

invite

[string]

A list of user IDs to invite to the room. This will tell the server to invite everyone in the list to the newly created room.

invite\_3pid

[Invite3pid]

A list of objects representing third party IDs to invite into the room.

room\_version

string

The room version to set for the room. If not provided, the homeserver is to use its configured default. If provided, the homeserver will return a 400 error with the errcode =M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION= if it does not support the room version.

creation\_content

CreationContent

Extra keys, such as =m.federate=, to be added to the content of the [[#m-room-create][m.room.create]] event. The server will clobber the following keys: =creator=, =room_version=. Future versions of the specification may allow the server to clobber other keys.

initial\_state

[StateEvent]

A list of state events to set in the new room. This allows the user to override the default state events set in the new room. The expected format of the state events are an object with type, state\_key and content keys set.

Takes precedence over events set by =preset=, but gets overriden by =name= and =topic= keys.

preset

enum

Convenience parameter for setting various default state events based on a preset.

If unspecified, the server should use the =visibility= to determine which preset to use. A visbility of =public= equates to a preset of =public_chat= and =private= visibility equates to a preset of =private_chat=. One of: ["private\_chat", "public\_chat", "trusted\_private\_chat"]

is\_direct

boolean

This flag makes the server set the =is_direct= flag on the =m.room.member= events sent to the users in =invite= and =invite_3pid=. See [[#module-dm][Direct Messaging]] for more information.

power\_level\_content\_override

Power Level Event Content

The power level content to override in the default power level event. This object is applied on top of the generated [[#m-room-power-levels][m.room.power\_levels]] event content prior to it being sent to the room. Defaults to overriding nothing.

The request is invalid. A meaningful =errcode= and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection include:

- The request body is malformed (=errcode= set to =M_BAD_JSON= or =M_NOT_JSON=).
- The room alias specified is already taken (=errcode= set to =M_ROOM_IN_USE=).
- The initial state implied by the parameters to the request is invalid: for example, the user's =power_level= is set below that necessary to set the room name (=errcode= set to =M_INVALID_ROOM_STATE=).
- The homeserver doesn't support the requested room version, or one or more users being invited to the new room are residents of a homeserver which does not support the requested room version. The =errcode= will be =M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION= in these cases.

Servers may host aliases for rooms with human-friendly names. Aliases take the form =#friendlyname:server.name=.

As room aliases are scoped to a particular homeserver domain name, it is likely that a homeserver will reject attempts to maintain aliases on other domain names. This specification does not provide a way for homeservers to send update requests to other servers. However, homeservers MUST handle =GET= requests to resolve aliases on other servers; they should do this using the federation API if necessary.

Rooms do not store a list of all aliases present on a room, though members of the room with relevant permissions may publish preferred aliases through the =m.room.canonical_alias= state event. The aliases in the state event should point to the room ID they are published within, however room aliases can and do drift to other room IDs over time. Clients SHOULD NOT treat the aliases as accurate. They SHOULD be checked before they are used or shared with another user. If a room appears to have a room alias of =#alias:example.com=, this SHOULD be checked to make sure that the room's ID matches the =room_id= returned from the request.

** [[#id285][10.3   Permissions]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: permissions
:END:

Note

This section is a work in progress.

Permissions for rooms are done via the concept of power levels - to do any action in a room a user must have a suitable power level. Power levels are stored as state events in a given room. The power levels required for operations and the power levels for users are defined in =m.room.power_levels=, where both a default and specific users' power levels can be set. By default all users have a power level of 0, other than the room creator whose power level defaults to 100. Users can grant other users increased power levels up to their own power level. For example, user A with a power level of 50 could increase the power level of user B to a maximum of level 50. Power levels for users are tracked per-room even if the user is not present in the room. The keys contained in =m.room.power_levels= determine the levels required for certain operations such as kicking, banning and sending state events. See [[#m-room-power-levels][m.room.power\_levels]] for more information.

Clients may wish to assign names to particular power levels. A suggested mapping is as follows: - 0 User - 50 Moderator - 100 Admin

** [[#id286][10.4   Room membership]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: room-membership
:END:

Users need to be a member of a room in order to send and receive events in that room. There are several states in which a user may be, in relation to a room:

- Unrelated (the user cannot send or receive events in the room)
- Invited (the user has been invited to participate in the room, but is not yet participating)
- Joined (the user can send and receive events in the room)
- Banned (the user is not allowed to join the room)

There is an exception to the requirement that a user join a room before sending events to it: users may send an =m.room.member= event to a room with =content.membership= set to =leave= to reject an invitation if they have currently been invited to a room but have not joined it.

Some rooms require that users be invited to it before they can join; others allow anyone to join. Whether a given room is an "invite-only" room is determined by the room config key =m.room.join_rules=. It can have one of the following values:

- =public= :: This room is free for anyone to join without an invite.
- =invite= :: This room can only be joined if you were invited.

The allowable state transitions of membership are:

*** [[#id292][10.4.3   Leaving rooms]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: leaving-rooms
:END:

A user can leave a room to stop receiving events for that room. A user must have been invited to or have joined the room before they are eligible to leave the room. Leaving a room to which the user has been invited rejects the invite. Once a user leaves a room, it will no longer appear in the response to the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] API unless it is explicitly requested via a filter with the =include_leave= field set to =true=.

Whether or not they actually joined the room, if the room is an "invite-only" room the user will need to be re-invited before they can re-join the room.

A user can also forget a room which they have left. Rooms which have been forgotten will never appear the response to the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] API, until the user re-joins or is re-invited.

A user may wish to force another user to leave a room. This can be done by 'kicking' the other user. To do so, the user performing the kick MUST have the required power level. Once a user has been kicked, the behaviour is the same as if they had left of their own accord. In particular, the user is free to re-join if the room is not "invite-only".

*** [[#id296][10.4.4   Banning users in a room]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: banning-users-in-a-room
:END:

A user may decide to ban another user in a room. 'Banning' forces the target user to leave the room and prevents them from re-joining the room. A banned user will not be treated as a joined user, and so will not be able to send or receive events in the room. In order to ban someone, the user performing the ban MUST have the required power level. To ban a user, a request should be made to [[#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-ban][=/rooms/<room_id>/ban=]] with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "user_id": "<user id to ban>"
  "reason": "string: <reason for the ban>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Banning a user adjusts the banned member's membership state to =ban=. Like with other membership changes, a user can directly adjust the target member's state, by making a request to =/rooms/<room id>/state/m.room.member/<user id>=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "membership": "ban"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

A user must be explicitly unbanned with a request to [[#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-unban][=/rooms/<room_id>/unban=]] before they can re-join the room or be re-invited.

**** [[#id297][10.4.4.1   =POST /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomId}/ban=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: post-_matrixclientr0roomsroomidban
:END:

Ban a user in the room. If the user is currently in the room, also kick them.

When a user is banned from a room, they may not join it or be invited to it until they are unbanned.

The caller must have the required power level in order to perform this operation.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN",
  "error": "You do not have a high enough power level to ban from this room."

:CUSTOM_ID: post-_matrixclientr0user_directorysearch
:END:

Performs a search for users. The homeserver may determine which subset of users are searched, however the homeserver MUST at a minimum consider the users the requesting user shares a room with and those who reside in public rooms (known to the homeserver). The search MUST consider local users to the homeserver, and SHOULD query remote users as part of the search.

The search is performed case-insensitively on user IDs and display names preferably using a collation determined based upon the =Accept-Language= header provided in the request, if present.

*** [[#id313][11.2.6   Events on Change of Profile Information]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: events-on-change-of-profile-information
:END:

Because the profile display name and avatar information are likely to be used in many places of a client's display, changes to these fields cause an automatic propagation event to occur, informing likely-interested parties of the new values. This change is conveyed using two separate mechanisms:

- a =m.room.member= event (with a =join= membership) is sent to every room the user is a member of, to update the =displayname= and =avatar_url=.
- a =m.presence= presence status update is sent, again containing the new values of the =displayname= and =avatar_url= keys, in addition to the required =presence= key containing the current presence state of the user.

Both of these should be done automatically by the homeserver when a user successfully changes their display name or avatar URL fields.

Additionally, when homeservers emit room membership events for their own users, they should include the display name and avatar URL fields in these events so that clients already have these details to hand, and do not have to perform extra round trips to query it.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security
:END:

** [[#id315][12.1   Rate limiting]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rate-limiting
:END:

Homeservers SHOULD implement rate limiting to reduce the risk of being overloaded. If a request is refused due to rate limiting, it should return a standard error response of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "error": "string",
  "retry_after_ms": integer (optional)
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =retry_after_ms= key SHOULD be included to tell the client how long they have to wait in milliseconds before they can try again.

* [[#id316][13   Modules]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modules
:END:

Modules are parts of the Client-Server API which are not universal to all endpoints. Modules are strictly defined within this specification and should not be mistaken for experimental extensions or optional features. A compliant server implementation MUST support all modules and supporting specification (unless the implementation only targets clients of certain profiles, in which case only the required modules for those feature profiles MUST be implemented). A compliant client implementation MUST support all the required modules and supporting specification for the [[#feature-profiles][Feature Profile]] it targets.

** [[#id317][13.1   Feature Profiles]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: feature-profiles
:END:

Matrix supports many different kinds of clients: from embedded IoT devices to desktop clients. Not all clients can provide the same feature sets as other clients e.g. due to lack of physical hardware such as not having a screen. Clients can fall into one of several profiles and each profile contains a set of features that the client MUST support. This section details a set of "feature profiles". Clients are expected to implement a profile in its entirety in order for it to be classified as that profile.

/Message Event/

This event is used when sending messages in a room. Messages are not limited to be text. The =msgtype= key outlines the type of message, e.g. text, audio, image, video, etc. The =body= key is text and MUST be used with every kind of =msgtype= as a fallback mechanism for when a client cannot render a message. This allows clients to display /something/ even if it is just plain text. For more information on =msgtypes=, see [[#m-room-message-msgtypes][m.room.message msgtypes]].

/Message Event/

*NB: Usage of this event is discouraged in favour of the* [[#module-receipts][receipts module]]. *Most clients will not recognise this event.* Feedback events are events sent to acknowledge a message in some way. There are two supported acknowledgements: =delivered= (sent when the event has been received) and =read= (sent when the event has been observed by the end-user). The =target_event_id= should reference the =m.room.message= event being acknowledged.

| Content Key         | Type     | Description                                                       |

- Usage of this event is discouraged for several reasons: :: 

  - The number of feedback events will grow very quickly with the number of users in the room. This event provides no way to "batch" feedback, unlike the [[#module-receipts][receipts module]].
  - Pairing feedback to messages gets complicated when paginating as feedback arrives before the message it is acknowledging.
  - There are no guarantees that the client has seen the event ID being acknowledged.

A room has an opaque room ID which is not human-friendly to read. A room alias is human-friendly, but not all rooms have room aliases. The room name is a human-friendly string designed to be displayed to the end-user. The room name is not unique, as multiple rooms can have the same room name set.

A room with an =m.room.name= event with an absent, null, or empty =name= field should be treated the same as a room with no =m.room.name= event.

An event of this type is automatically created when creating a room using =/createRoom= with the =name= key.

This event is used to "pin" particular events in a room for other participants to review later. The order of the pinned events is guaranteed and based upon the order supplied in the event. Clients should be aware that the current user may not be able to see some of the events pinned due to visibility settings in the room.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.room.message-msgtypes
:END:

Each [[#m-room-message][m.room.message]] MUST have a =msgtype= key which identifies the type of message being sent. Each type has their own required and optional keys, as outlined below. If a client cannot display the given =msgtype= then it SHOULD display the fallback plain text =body= key instead.

Some message types support HTML in the event content that clients should prefer to display if available. Currently =m.text=, =m.emote=, and =m.notice= support an additional =format= parameter of =org.matrix.custom.html=. When this field is present, a =formatted_body= with the HTML must be provided. The plain text version of the HTML should be provided in the =body=.

Clients should limit the HTML they render to avoid Cross-Site Scripting, HTML injection, and similar attacks. The strongly suggested set of HTML tags to permit, denying the use and rendering of anything else, is: =font=, =del=, =h1=, =h2=, =h3=, =h4=, =h5=, =h6=, =blockquote=, =p=, =a=, =ul=, =ol=, =sup=, =sub=, =li=, =b=, =i=, =u=, =strong=, =em=, =strike=, =code=, =hr=, =br=, =div=, =table=, =thead=, =tbody=, =tr=, =th=, =td=, =caption=, =pre=, =span=, =img=.

Not all attributes on those tags should be permitted as they may be avenues for other disruption attempts, such as adding =onclick= handlers or excessively large text. Clients should only permit the attributes listed for the tags below. Where =data-mx-bg-color= and =data-mx-color= are listed, clients should translate the value (a 6-character hex color code) to the appropriate CSS/attributes for the tag.

| =font=:   | =data-mx-bg-color=, =data-mx-color=                                                                                                          |
| =span=:   | =data-mx-bg-color=, =data-mx-color=                                                                                                          |
| =a=:      | =name=, =target=, =href= (provided the value is not relative and has a scheme matching one of: =https=, =http=, =ftp=, =mailto=, =magnet=)   |
| =img=:    | =width=, =height=, =alt=, =title=, =src= (provided it is a [[#module-content][Matrix Content (MXC) URI]])                                    |
| =ol=:     | =start=                                                                                                                                      |
| =code=:   | =class= (only classes which start with =language-= for syntax highlighting)                                                                  |

Additionally, web clients should ensure that /all/ =a= tags get a =rel="noopener"= to prevent the target page from referencing the client's tab/window.

Tags must not be nested more than 100 levels deep. Clients should only support the subset of tags they can render, falling back to other representations of the tags where possible. For example, a client may not be able to render tables correctly and instead could fall back to rendering tab-delimited text.

In addition to not rendering unsafe HTML, clients should not emit unsafe HTML in events. Likewise, clients should not generate HTML that is not needed, such as extra paragraph tags surrounding text due to Rich Text Editors. HTML included in events should otherwise be valid, such as having appropriate closing tags, appropriate attributes (considering the custom ones defined in this specification), and generally valid structure.

A special tag, =mx-reply=, may appear on rich replies (described below) and should be allowed if, and only if, the tag appears as the very first tag in the =formatted_body=. The tag cannot be nested and cannot be located after another tag in the tree. Because the tag contains HTML, an =mx-reply= is expected to have a partner closing tag and should be treated similar to a =div=. Clients that support rich replies will end up stripping the tag and its contents and therefore may wish to exclude the tag entirely.

Note

A future iteration of the specification will support more powerful and extensible message formatting options, such as the proposal [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1225][MSC1225]].

The =m.notice= type is primarily intended for responses from automated clients. An =m.notice= message must be treated the same way as a regular =m.text= message with two exceptions. Firstly, clients should present =m.notice= messages to users in a distinct manner, and secondly, =m.notice= messages must never be automatically responded to. This helps to prevent infinite-loop situations where two automated clients continuously exchange messages.

*** [[#id344][13.2.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-1
:END:

Clients SHOULD verify the structure of incoming events to ensure that the expected keys exist and that they are of the right type. Clients can discard malformed events or display a placeholder message to the user. Redacted =m.room.message= events MUST be removed from the client. This can either be replaced with placeholder text (e.g. "[REDACTED]") or the redacted message can be removed entirely from the messages view.

Events which have attachments (e.g. =m.image=, =m.file=) SHOULD be uploaded using the [[#module-content][content repository module]] where available. The resulting =mxc://= URI can then be used in the =url= key.

Clients MAY include a client generated thumbnail image for an attachment under a =info.thumbnail_url= key. The thumbnail SHOULD also be a =mxc://= URI. Clients displaying events with attachments can either use the client generated thumbnail or ask its homeserver to generate a thumbnail from the original attachment using the [[#module-content][content repository module]].

**** [[#id345][13.2.2.1   Recommendations when sending messages]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: recommendations-when-sending-messages
:END:

In the event of send failure, clients SHOULD retry requests using an exponential-backoff algorithm for a certain amount of time T. It is recommended that T is no longer than 5 minutes. After this time, the client should stop retrying and mark the message as "unsent". Users should be able to manually resend unsent messages.

Users may type several messages at once and send them all in quick succession. Clients SHOULD preserve the order in which they were sent by the user. This means that clients should wait for the response to the previous request before sending the next request. This can lead to head-of-line blocking. In order to reduce the impact of head-of-line blocking, clients should use a queue per room rather than a global queue, as ordering is only relevant within a single room rather than between rooms.

**** [[#id346][13.2.2.2   Local echo]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: local-echo
:END:

Messages SHOULD appear immediately in the message view when a user presses the "send" button. This should occur even if the message is still sending. This is referred to as "local echo". Clients SHOULD implement "local echo" of messages. Clients MAY display messages in a different format to indicate that the server has not processed the message. This format should be removed when the server responds.

Clients need to be able to match the message they are sending with the same message which they receive from the event stream. The echo of the same message from the event stream is referred to as "remote echo". Both echoes need to be identified as the same message in order to prevent duplicate messages being displayed. Ideally this pairing would occur transparently to the user: the UI would not flicker as it transitions from local to remote. Flickering can be reduced through clients making use of the transaction ID they used to send a particular event. The transaction ID used will be included in the event's =unsigned= data as =transaction_id= when it arrives through the event stream.

Clients unable to make use of the transaction ID are likely to experience flickering when the remote echo arrives on the event stream /before/ the request to send the message completes. In that case the event arrives before the client has obtained an event ID, making it impossible to identify it as a remote echo. This results in the client displaying the message twice for some time (depending on the server responsiveness) before the original request to send the message completes. Once it completes, the client can take remedial actions to remove the duplicate event by looking for duplicate event IDs.

**** [[#id347][13.2.2.3   Calculating the display name for a user]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: calculating-the-display-name-for-a-user
:END:

Clients may wish to show the human-readable display name of a room member as part of a membership list, or when they send a message. However, different members may have conflicting display names. Display names MUST be disambiguated before showing them to the user, in order to prevent spoofing of other users.

To ensure this is done consistently across clients, clients SHOULD use the following algorithm to calculate a disambiguated display name for a given user:

1. Inspect the =m.room.member= state event for the relevant user id.
2. If the =m.room.member= state event has no =displayname= field, or if that field has a =null= value, use the raw user id as the display name. Otherwise:
3. If the =m.room.member= event has a =displayname= which is unique among members of the room with =membership: join= or =membership: invite=, use the given =displayname= as the user-visible display name. Otherwise:
4. The =m.room.member= event has a non-unique =displayname=. This should be disambiguated using the user id, for example "display name (@id:homeserver.org)".

Developers should take note of the following when implementing the above algorithm:

- The user-visible display name of one member can be affected by changes in the state of another member. For example, if =@user1:matrix.org= is present in a room, with =displayname: Alice=, then when =@user2:example.com= joins the room, also with =displayname: Alice=, /both/ users must be given disambiguated display names. Similarly, when one of the users then changes their display name, there is no longer a clash, and /both/ users can be given their chosen display name. Clients should be alert to this possibility and ensure that all affected users are correctly renamed.
- The display name of a room may also be affected by changes in the membership list. This is due to the room name sometimes being based on user display names (see [[#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room][Calculating the display name for a room]]).
- If the entire membership list is searched for clashing display names, this leads to an O(N\^2) implementation for building the list of room members. This will be very inefficient for rooms with large numbers of members. It is recommended that client implementations maintain a hash table mapping from =displayname= to a list of room members using that name. Such a table can then be used for efficient calculation of whether disambiguation is needed.

**** [[#id348][13.2.2.4   Displaying membership information with messages]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: displaying-membership-information-with-messages
:END:

Clients may wish to show the display name and avatar URL of the room member who sent a message. This can be achieved by inspecting the =m.room.member= state event for that user ID (see [[#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-user][Calculating the display name for a user]]).

When a user paginates the message history, clients may wish to show the *historical* display name and avatar URL for a room member. This is possible because older =m.room.member= events are returned when paginating. This can be implemented efficiently by keeping two sets of room state: old and current. As new events arrive and/or the user paginates back in time, these two sets of state diverge from each other. New events update the current state and paginated events update the old state. When paginated events are processed sequentially, the old state represents the state of the room /at the time the event was sent/. This can then be used to set the historical display name and avatar URL.

**** [[#id349][13.2.2.5   Calculating the display name for a room]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room
:END:

Clients may wish to show a human-readable name for a room. There are a number of possibilities for choosing a useful name. To ensure that rooms are named consistently across clients, clients SHOULD use the following algorithm to choose a name:

1. If the room has an [[#m-room-name][m.room.name]] state event with a non-empty =name= field, use the name given by that field.
2. If the room has an [[#m-room-canonical-alias][m.room.canonical\_alias]] state event with a valid =alias= field, use the alias given by that field as the name. Note that clients should avoid using =alt_aliases= when calculating the room name.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, a name should be composed based on the members of the room. Clients should consider [[#m-room-member][m.room.member]] events for users other than the logged-in user, as defined below.

   1. If the number of =m.heroes= for the room are greater or equal to =m.joined_member_count + m.invited_member_count - 1=, then use the membership events for the heroes to calculate display names for the users ([[#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-user][disambiguating them if required]]) and concatenating them. For example, the client may choose to show "Alice, Bob, and Charlie (@charlie:example.org)" as the room name. The client may optionally limit the number of users it uses to generate a room name.
   2. If there are fewer heroes than =m.joined_member_count + m.invited_member_count                                                             - 1=, and =m.joined_member_count + m.invited_member_count= is greater than 1, the client should use the heroes to calculate display names for the users ([[#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-user][disambiguating them if required]]) and concatenating them alongside a count of the remaining users. For example, "Alice, Bob, and 1234 others".
   3. If =m.joined_member_count + m.invited_member_count= is less than or equal to 1 (indicating the member is alone), the client should use the rules above to indicate that the room was empty. For example, "Empty Room (was Alice)", "Empty Room (was Alice and 1234 others)", or "Empty Room" if there are no heroes.

Clients SHOULD internationalise the room name to the user's language when using the =m.heroes= to calculate the name. Clients SHOULD use minimum 5 heroes to calculate room names where possible, but may use more or less to fit better with their user experience.

**** [[#id350][13.2.2.6   Forming relationships between events]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: forming-relationships-between-events
:END:

In some cases, events may wish to reference other events. This could be to form a thread of messages for the user to follow along with, or to provide more context as to what a particular event is describing. Currently, the only kind of relation defined is a "rich reply" where a user may reference another message to create a thread-like conversation.

Relationships are defined under an =m.relates_to= key in the event's =content=. If the event is of the type =m.room.encrypted=, the =m.relates_to= key MUST NOT be covered by the encryption and instead be put alongside the encryption information held in the =content=.

***** [[#id351][13.2.2.6.1   Rich replies]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rich-replies
:END:

Users may wish to reference another message when forming their own message, and clients may wish to better embed the referenced message for the user to have a better context for the conversation being had. This sort of embedding another message in a message is known as a "rich reply", or occasionally just a "reply".

A rich reply is formed through use of an =m.relates_to= relation for =m.in_reply_to= where a single key, =event_id=, is used to reference the event being replied to. The referenced event ID SHOULD belong to the same room where the reply is being sent. Clients should be cautious of the event ID belonging to another room, or being invalid entirely. Rich replies can only be constructed in the form of =m.room.message= events with a =msgtype= of =m.text= or =m.notice=. Due to the fallback requirements, rich replies cannot be constructed for types of =m.emote=, =m.file=, etc. Rich replies may reference any other =m.room.message= event, however. Rich replies may reference another event which also has a rich reply, infinitely.

An =m.in_reply_to= relationship looks like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  ...
  "type": "m.room.message",
  "content": {
  "msgtype": "m.text",
  "body": "<body including fallback>",
  "format": "org.matrix.custom.html",
  "formatted_body": "<HTML including fallback>",
  "m.relates_to": {
  "m.in_reply_to": {
  "event_id": "$another:event.com"
  }
  }
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** [[#id352][13.2.2.6.1.1   Fallbacks and event representation]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fallbacks-and-event-representation
:END:

Some clients may not have support for rich replies and therefore need a fallback to use instead. Clients that do not support rich replies should render the event as if rich replies were not special.

Clients that do support rich replies MUST provide the fallback format on replies, and MUST strip the fallback before rendering the reply. Rich replies MUST have a =format= of =org.matrix.custom.html= and therefore a =formatted_body= alongside the =body= and appropriate =msgtype=. The specific fallback text is different for each =msgtype=, however the general format for the =body= is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > <@alice:example.org> This is the original body

  This is where the reply goes
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =formatted_body= should use the following template:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <mx-reply>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!somewhere:example.org/$event:example.org">In reply to</a>
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alice:example.org">@alice:example.org</a>
  <br />
  <!-- This is where the related event's HTML would be. -->
  </blockquote>
  </mx-reply>
  This is where the reply goes.
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the related event does not have a =formatted_body=, the event's =body= should be considered after encoding any HTML special characters. Note that the =href= in both of the anchors use a [[../appendices.html#matrix-to-navigation][matrix.to URI]].

[[#id353][13.2.2.6.1.1.1   Stripping the fallback]]

Clients which support rich replies MUST strip the fallback from the event before rendering the event. This is because the text provided in the fallback cannot be trusted to be an accurate representation of the event. After removing the fallback, clients are recommended to represent the event referenced by =m.in_reply_to= similar to the fallback's representation, although clients do have creative freedom for their user interface. Clients should prefer the =formatted_body= over the =body=, just like with other =m.room.message= events.

To strip the fallback on the =body=, the client should iterate over each line of the string, removing any lines that start with the fallback prefix ("> ", including the space, without quotes) and stopping when a line is encountered without the prefix. This prefix is known as the "fallback prefix sequence".

To strip the fallback on the =formatted_body=, the client should remove the entirety of the =mx-reply= tag.

[[#id354][13.2.2.6.1.1.2   Fallback for =m.text=, =m.notice=, and unrecognised message types]]

Using the prefix sequence, the first line of the related event's =body= should be prefixed with the user's ID, followed by each line being prefixed with the fallback prefix sequence. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > <@alice:example.org> This is the first line
  > This is the second line

  This is the reply
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =formatted_body= uses the template defined earlier in this section.

[[#id355][13.2.2.6.1.1.3   Fallback for =m.emote=]]

Similar to the fallback for =m.text=, each line gets prefixed with the fallback prefix sequence. However an asterisk should be inserted before the user's ID, like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > * <@alice:example.org> feels like today is going to be a great day

  This is the reply
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =formatted_body= has a subtle difference for the template where the asterisk is also inserted ahead of the user's ID:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <mx-reply>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!somewhere:example.org/$event:example.org">In reply to</a>

The related event's =body= would be a file name, which may not be very descriptive. The related event should additionally not have a =format= or =formatted_body= in the =content= - if the event does have a =format= and/or =formatted_body=, those fields should be ignored. Because the filename alone may not be descriptive, the related event's =body= should be considered to be ="sent a file."= such that the output looks similar to the following:

This module outlines how two users in a room can set up a Voice over IP (VoIP) call to each other. Voice and video calls are built upon the WebRTC 1.0 standard. Call signalling is achieved by sending [[#sect-events][message events]] to the room. In this version of the spec, only two-party communication is supported (e.g. between two peers, or between a peer and a multi-point conferencing unit). This means that clients MUST only send call events to rooms with exactly two participants.

**** [[#id366][13.3.2.1   Glare]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: glare
:END:

"Glare" is a problem which occurs when two users call each other at roughly the same time. This results in the call failing to set up as there already is an incoming/outgoing call. A glare resolution algorithm can be used to determine which call to hangup and which call to answer. If both clients implement the same algorithm then they will both select the same call and the call will be successfully connected.

As calls are "placed" to rooms rather than users, the glare resolution algorithm outlined below is only considered for calls which are to the same room. The algorithm is as follows:

- If an =m.call.invite= to a room is received whilst the client is *preparing to send* an =m.call.invite= to the same room:

  - the client should cancel its outgoing call and instead automatically accept the incoming call on behalf of the user.

- If an =m.call.invite= to a room is received *after the client has sent* an =m.call.invite= to the same room and is waiting for a response:

  - the client should perform a lexicographical comparison of the call IDs of the two calls and use the /lesser/ of the two calls, aborting the greater. If the incoming call is the lesser, the client should accept this call on behalf of the user.

The call setup should appear seamless to the user as if they had simply placed a call and the other party had accepted. This means any media stream that had been setup for use on a call should be transferred and used for the call that replaces it.

*** [[#id373][13.4.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-3

When a client receives an =m.typing= event, it MUST use the user ID list to *REPLACE* its knowledge of every user who is currently typing. The reason for this is that the server /does not remember/ users who are not currently typing as that list gets big quickly. The client should mark as not typing any user ID who is not in that list.

It is recommended that clients store a =boolean= indicating whether the user is typing or not. Whilst this value is =true= a timer should fire periodically every N seconds to send a typing HTTP request. The value of N is recommended to be no more than 20-30 seconds. This request should be re-sent by the client to continue informing the server the user is still typing. As subsequent requests will replace older requests, a safety margin of 5 seconds before the expected timeout runs out is recommended. When the user stops typing, the state change of the =boolean= to =false= should trigger another HTTP request to inform the server that the user has stopped typing.

This module adds in support for receipts. These receipts are a form of acknowledgement of an event. This module defines a single acknowledgement: =m.read= which indicates that the user has read up to a given event.

Sending a receipt for each event can result in sending large amounts of traffic to a homeserver. To prevent this from becoming a problem, receipts are implemented using "up to" markers. This marker indicates that the acknowledgement applies to all events "up to and including" the event specified. For example, marking an event as "read" would indicate that the user had read all events /up to/ the referenced event. See the [[#receiving-notifications][Receiving notifications]] section for more information on how read receipts affect notification counts.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-4
:END:

In =/sync=, receipts are listed under the =ephemeral= array of events for a given room. New receipts that come down the event streams are deltas which update existing mappings. Clients should replace older receipt acknowledgements based on =user_id= and =receipt_type= pairs. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Client receives m.receipt:
  user = @alice:example.com
  receipt_type = m.read
  event_id = $aaa:example.com

  Client receives another m.receipt:
  user = @alice:example.com
  receipt_type = m.read
  event_id = $bbb:example.com

  The client should replace the older acknowledgement for $aaa:example.com with
  this one for $bbb:example.com
#+END_EXAMPLE

Clients should send read receipts when there is some certainty that the event in question has been *displayed* to the user. Simply receiving an event does not provide enough certainty that the user has seen the event. The user SHOULD need to /take some action/ such as viewing the room that the event was sent to or dismissing a notification in order for the event to count as "read". Clients SHOULD NOT send read receipts for events sent by their own user.

A client can update the markers for its user by interacting with the following HTTP APIs.

*** [[#id381][13.5.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-2
:END:

For efficiency, receipts SHOULD be batched into one event per room before delivering them to clients.

Receipts are sent across federation as EDUs with type =m.receipt=. The format of the EDUs are:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  <room_id>: {
  <receipt_type>: {
  <user_id>: { <content> }
  },
  ...
  },
  ...
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

These are always sent as deltas to previously sent receipts. Currently only a single =<receipt_type>= should be used: =m.read=.

*** [[#id382][13.5.4   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-3

As receipts are sent outside the context of the event graph, there are no integrity checks performed on the contents of =m.receipt= events.

** [[#id383][13.6   Fully read markers]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fully-read-markers
:END:

The history for a given room may be split into three sections: messages the user has read (or indicated they aren't interested in them), messages the user might have read some but not others, and messages the user hasn't seen yet. The "fully read marker" (also known as a "read marker") marks the last event of the first section, whereas the user's read receipt marks the last event of the second section.

*** [[#id384][13.6.1   Events]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: events-6
:END:

The user's fully read marker is kept as an event in the room's [[#client-config][account data]]. The event may be read to determine the user's current fully read marker location in the room, and just like other account data events the event will be pushed down the event stream when updated.

The fully read marker is kept under an =m.fully_read= event. If the event does not exist on the user's account data, the fully read marker should be considered to be the user's read receipt location.

**** [[#id385][13.6.1.1   =m.fully_read=]]

*** [[#id386][13.6.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-5
:END:

The client cannot update fully read markers by directly modifying the =m.fully_read= account data event. Instead, the client must make use of the read markers API to change the values.

The read markers API can additionally update the user's read receipt (=m.read=) location in the same operation as setting the fully read marker location. This is because read receipts and read markers are commonly updated at the same time, and therefore the client might wish to save an extra HTTP call. Providing an =m.read= location performs the same task as a request to =/receipt/m.read/$event:example.org=.

*** [[#id388][13.6.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-3
:END:

The server MUST prevent clients from setting =m.fully_read= directly in room account data. The server must additionally ensure that it treats the presence of =m.read= in the =/read_markers= request the same as how it would for a request to =/receipt/m.read/$event:example.org=.

Upon updating the =m.fully_read= event due to a request to =/read_markers=, the server MUST send the updated account data event through to the client via the event stream (eg: =/sync=), provided any applicable filters are also satisfied.

** [[#id389][13.7   Presence]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: presence
:END:

Each user has the concept of presence information. This encodes:

- Whether the user is currently online
- How recently the user was last active (as seen by the server)
- Whether a given client considers the user to be currently idle
- Arbitrary information about the user's current status (e.g. "in a meeting").

This information is collated from both per-device (=online=, =idle=, =last_active=) and per-user (status) data, aggregated by the user's homeserver and transmitted as an =m.presence= event. Presence events are sent to interested parties where users share a room membership.

User's presence state is represented by the =presence= key, which is an enum of one of the following:

- =online= : The default state when the user is connected to an event stream.
- =unavailable= : The user is not reachable at this time e.g. they are idle.
- =offline= : The user is not connected to an event stream or is explicitly suppressing their profile information from being sent.

**** [[#id395][13.7.2.3   Last active ago]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: last-active-ago
:END:

The server maintains a timestamp of the last time it saw a pro-active event from the user. A pro-active event may be sending a message to a room or changing presence state to =online=. This timestamp is presented via a key called =last_active_ago= which gives the relative number of milliseconds since the pro-active event.

To reduce the number of presence updates sent to clients the server may include a =currently_active= boolean field when the presence state is =online=. When true, the server will not send further updates to the last active time until an update is sent to the client with either a) =currently_active= set to false or b) a presence state other than =online=. During this period clients must consider the user to be currently active, irrespective of the last active time.

The last active time must be up to date whenever the server gives a presence event to the client. The =currently_active= mechanism should purely be used by servers to stop sending continuous presence updates, as opposed to disabling last active tracking entirely. Thus clients can fetch up to date last active times by explicitly requesting the presence for a given user.

**** [[#id396][13.7.2.4   Idle timeout]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: idle-timeout
:END:

The server will automatically set a user's presence to =unavailable= if their last active time was over a threshold value (e.g. 5 minutes). Clients can manually set a user's presence to =unavailable=. Any activity that bumps the last active time on any of the user's clients will cause the server to automatically set their presence to =online=.

** [[#id398][13.8   Content repository]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: content-repository
:END:

The content repository (or "media repository") allows users to upload files to their homeserver for later use. For example, files which the user wants to send to a room would be uploaded here, as would an avatar the user wants to use.

Uploads are POSTed to a resource on the user's local homeserver which returns a MXC URI which can later be used to GET the download. Content is downloaded from the recipient's local homeserver, which must first transfer the content from the origin homeserver using the same API (unless the origin and destination homeservers are the same).

When serving content, the server SHOULD provide a =Content-Security-Policy= header. The recommended policy is =sandbox; default-src 'none'; script-src                                                   'none'; plugin-types application/pdf; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; object-src                                                   'self';=.

**** [[#id407][13.8.2.7   Thumbnails]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: thumbnails
:END:

The homeserver SHOULD be able to supply thumbnails for uploaded images and videos. The exact file types which can be thumbnailed are not currently specified - see [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1938][Issue #1938]] for more information.

The thumbnail methods are "crop" and "scale". "scale" tries to return an image where either the width or the height is smaller than the requested size. The client should then scale and letterbox the image if it needs to fit within a given rectangle. "crop" tries to return an image where the width and height are close to the requested size and the aspect matches the requested size. The client should scale the image if it needs to fit within a given rectangle.

The dimensions given to the thumbnail API are the minimum size the client would prefer. Servers must never return thumbnails smaller than the client's requested dimensions, unless the content being thumbnailed is smaller than the dimensions. When the content is smaller than the requested dimensions, servers should return the original content rather than thumbnail it.

Servers SHOULD produce thumbnails with the following dimensions and methods:

- 32x32, crop
- 96x96, crop
- 320x240, scale
- 640x480, scale
- 800x600, scale

- In summary: :: 

  - "scale" maintains the original aspect ratio of the image
  - "crop" provides an image in the aspect ratio of the sizes given in the request
  - The server will return an image larger than or equal to the dimensions requested where possible.

Servers MUST NOT upscale thumbnails under any circumstance. Servers MUST NOT return a smaller thumbnail than requested, unless the original content makes that impossible.

*** [[#id408][13.8.3   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-5
:END:

The HTTP GET endpoint does not require any authentication. Knowing the URL of the content is sufficient to retrieve the content, even if the entity isn't in the room.

MXC URIs are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks such as =mxc://127.0.0.1/../../../some_service/etc/passwd=. This would cause the target homeserver to try to access and return this file. As such, homeservers MUST sanitise MXC URIs by allowing only alphanumeric (=A-Za-z0-9=), =_= and =-= characters in the =server-name= and =media-id= values. This set of whitelisted characters allows URL-safe base64 encodings specified in RFC 4648. Applying this character whitelist is preferable to blacklisting =.= and =/= as there are techniques around blacklisted characters (percent-encoded characters, UTF-8 encoded traversals, etc).

Homeservers have additional content-specific concerns:

- Clients may try to upload very large files. Homeservers should not store files that are too large and should not serve them to clients, returning a HTTP 413 error with the =M_TOO_LARGE= code.
- Clients may try to upload very large images. Homeservers should not attempt to generate thumbnails for images that are too large, returning a HTTP 413 error with the =M_TOO_LARGE= code.
- Remote homeservers may host very large files or images. Homeservers should not proxy or thumbnail large files or images from remote homeservers, returning a HTTP 502 error with the =M_TOO_LARGE= code.
- Clients may try to upload a large number of files. Homeservers should limit the number and total size of media that can be uploaded by clients, returning a HTTP 403 error with the =M_FORBIDDEN= code.
- Clients may try to access a large number of remote files through a homeserver. Homeservers should restrict the number and size of remote files that it caches.
- Clients or remote homeservers may try to upload malicious files targeting vulnerabilities in either the homeserver thumbnailing or the client decoders.

** [[#id409][13.9   Send-to-Device messaging]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: send-to-device-messaging
:END:

This module provides a means by which clients can exchange signalling messages without them being stored permanently as part of a shared communication history. A message is delivered exactly once to each client device.

The primary motivation for this API is exchanging data that is meaningless or undesirable to persist in the room DAG - for example, one-time authentication tokens or key data. It is not intended for conversational data, which should be sent using the normal [[#put-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-send-eventtype-txnid][=/rooms/<room_id>/send=]] API for consistency throughout Matrix.

*** [[#id410][13.9.1   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-8
:END:

To send a message to other devices, a client should call [[#put-matrix-client-r0-sendtodevice-eventtype-txnid][=/sendToDevice=]]. Only one message can be sent to each device per transaction, and they must all have the same event type. The device ID in the request body can be set to =*= to request that the message be sent to all known devices.

If there are send-to-device messages waiting for a client, they will be returned by [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]], as detailed in [[#send-to-device-sync][Extensions to /sync]]. Clients should inspect the =type= of each returned event, and ignore any they do not understand.

*** [[#id411][13.9.2   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-4
:END:

Servers should store pending messages for local users until they are successfully delivered to the destination device. When a client calls [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] with an access token which corresponds to a device with pending messages, the server should list the pending messages, in order of arrival, in the response body.

When the client calls =/sync= again with the =next_batch= token from the first response, the server should infer that any send-to-device messages in that response have been delivered successfully, and delete them from the store.

If there is a large queue of send-to-device messages, the server should limit the number sent in each =/sync= response. 100 messages is recommended as a reasonable limit.

If the client sends messages to users on remote domains, those messages should be sent on to the remote servers via [[../server_server/r0.1.4.html#send-to-device-messaging][federation]].

:END:

Deleting devices has security implications: it invalidates the access\_token assigned to the device, so an attacker could use it to log out the real user (and do it repeatedly every time the real user tries to log in to block the attacker). Servers should require additional authentication beyond the access token when deleting devices (for example, requiring that the user resubmit their password).

The display names of devices are publicly visible. Clients should consider advising the user of this.

Each device should have one Ed25519 signing key. This key should be generated on the device from a cryptographically secure source, and the private part of the key should never be exported from the device. This key is used as the fingerprint for a device by other clients.

A device will generally need to generate a number of additional keys. Details of these will vary depending on the messaging algorithm in use.

Algorithms generally require device identity keys as well as signing keys. Some algorithms also require one-time keys to improve their secrecy and deniability. These keys are used once during session establishment, and are then thrown away.

For Olm version 1, each device requires a single Curve25519 identity key, and a number of signed Curve25519 one-time keys.

**** [[#id428][13.11.1.4   Uploading keys]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: uploading-keys
:END:

A device uploads the public parts of identity keys to their homeserver as a signed JSON object, using the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-upload][=/keys/upload=]] API. The JSON object must include the public part of the device's Ed25519 key, and must be signed by that key, as described in [[../appendices.html#signing-json][Signing JSON]].

One-time keys are also uploaded to the homeserver using the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-upload][=/keys/upload=]] API.

Devices must store the private part of each key they upload. They can discard the private part of a one-time key when they receive a message using that key. However it's possible that a one-time key given out by a homeserver will never be used, so the device that generates the key will never know that it can discard the key. Therefore a device could end up trying to store too many private keys. A device that is trying to store too many private keys may discard keys starting with the oldest.

**** [[#id429][13.11.1.5   Tracking the device list for a user]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tracking-the-device-list-for-a-user
:END:

Before Alice can send an encrypted message to Bob, she needs a list of each of his devices and the associated identity keys, so that she can establish an encryption session with each device. This list can be obtained by calling [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-query][=/keys/query=]], passing Bob's user ID in the =device_keys= parameter.

From time to time, Bob may add new devices, and Alice will need to know this so that she can include his new devices for later encrypted messages. A naive solution to this would be to call [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-query][=/keys/query=]] before sending each message - however, the number of users and devices may be large and this would be inefficient.

It is therefore expected that each client will maintain a list of devices for a number of users (in practice, typically each user with whom we share an encrypted room). Furthermore, it is likely that this list will need to be persisted between invocations of the client application (to preserve device verification data and to alert Alice if Bob suddenly gets a new device).

Alice's client can maintain a list of Bob's devices via the following process:

1. It first sets a flag to record that it is now tracking Bob's device list, and a separate flag to indicate that its list of Bob's devices is outdated. Both flags should be in storage which persists over client restarts.
2. It then makes a request to [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-query][=/keys/query=]], passing Bob's user ID in the =device_keys= parameter. When the request completes, it stores the resulting list of devices in persistent storage, and clears the 'outdated' flag.
3. During its normal processing of responses to [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]], Alice's client inspects the =changed= property of the [[#device-lists-sync][=device_lists=]] field. If it is tracking the device lists of any of the listed users, then it marks the device lists for those users outdated, and initiates another request to [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-query][=/keys/query=]] for them.
4. Periodically, Alice's client stores the =next_batch= field of the result from [[#get-matrix-client-r0-sync][=/sync=]] in persistent storage. If Alice later restarts her client, it can obtain a list of the users who have updated their device list while it was offline by calling [[#get-matrix-client-r0-keys-changes][=/keys/changes=]], passing the recorded =next_batch= field as the =from= parameter. If the client is tracking the device list of any of the users listed in the response, it marks them as outdated. It combines this list with those already flagged as outdated, and initiates a [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-query][=/keys/query=]] request for all of them.

Warning

Bob may update one of his devices while Alice has a request to =/keys/query= in flight. Alice's client may therefore see Bob's user ID in the =device_lists= field of the =/sync= response while the first request is in flight, and initiate a second request to =/keys/query=. This may lead to either of two related problems.

The first problem is that, when the first request completes, the client will clear the 'outdated' flag for Bob's devices. If the second request fails, or the client is shut down before it completes, this could lead to Alice using an outdated list of Bob's devices.

The second possibility is that, under certain conditions, the second request may complete /before/ the first one. When the first request completes, the client could overwrite the later results from the second request with those from the first request.

Clients MUST guard against these situations. For example, a client could ensure that only one request to =/keys/query= is in flight at a time for each user, by queuing additional requests until the first completes. Alternatively, the client could make a new request immediately, but ensure that the first request's results are ignored (possibly by cancelling the request).

Note

When Bob and Alice share a room, with Bob tracking Alice's devices, she may leave the room and then add a new device. Bob will not be notified of this change, as he doesn't share a room anymore with Alice. When they start sharing a room again, Bob has an out-of-date list of Alice's devices. In order to address this issue, Bob's homeserver will add Alice's user ID to the =changed= property of the =device_lists= field, thus Bob will update his list of Alice's devices as part of his normal processing. Note that Bob can also be notified when he stops sharing any room with Alice by inspecting the =left= property of the =device_lists= field, and as a result should remove her from its list of tracked users.

**** [[#id430][13.11.1.6   Sending encrypted attachments]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sending-encrypted-attachments
:END:

When encryption is enabled in a room, files should be uploaded encrypted on the homeserver.

In order to achieve this, a client should generate a single-use 256-bit AES key, and encrypt the file using AES-CTR. The counter should be 64-bit long, starting at 0 and prefixed by a random 64-bit Initialization Vector (IV), which together form a 128-bit unique counter block.

Warning

An IV must never be used multiple times with the same key. This implies that if there are multiple files to encrypt in the same message, typically an image and its thumbnail, the files must not share both the same key and IV.

Then, the encrypted file can be uploaded to the homeserver. The key and the IV must be included in the room event along with the resulting =mxc://= in order to allow recipients to decrypt the file. As the event containing those will be Megolm encrypted, the server will never have access to the decrypted file.

A hash of the ciphertext must also be included, in order to prevent the homeserver from changing the file content.

A client should send the data as an encrypted =m.room.message= event, using either =m.file= as the msgtype, or the appropriate msgtype for the file type. The key is sent using the [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#appendix-A.3][JSON Web Key]] format, with a [[https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#iana-section-jwk][W3C extension]].

Before Alice sends Bob encrypted data, or trusts data received from him, she may want to verify that she is actually communicating with him, rather than a man-in-the-middle.

In Matrix, verification works by Alice meeting Bob in person, or contacting him via some other trusted medium, and use [[#sas-verification][SAS Verification]] to interactively verify Bob's devices. Alice and Bob may also read aloud their unpadded base64 encoded Ed25519 public key, as returned by =/keys/query=.

Device verification may reach one of several conclusions. For example:

- Alice may "accept" the device. This means that she is satisfied that the device belongs to Bob. She can then encrypt sensitive material for that device, and knows that messages received were sent from that device.
- Alice may "reject" the device. She will do this if she knows or suspects that Bob does not control that device (or equivalently, does not trust Bob). She will not send sensitive material to that device, and cannot trust messages apparently received from it.
- Alice may choose to skip the device verification process. She is not able to verify that the device actually belongs to Bob, but has no reason to suspect otherwise. The encryption protocol continues to protect against passive eavesdroppers.

Note

Once the signing key has been verified, it is then up to the encryption protocol to verify that a given message was sent from a device holding that Ed25519 private key, or to encrypt a message so that it may only be decrypted by such a device. For the Olm protocol, this is documented at [[https://matrix.org/docs/olm_signing.html]].

**** [[#id434][13.11.2.1   Key verification framework]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-verification-framework
:END:

Verifying keys manually by reading out the Ed25519 key is not very user friendly, and can lead to errors. In order to help mitigate errors, and to make the process easier for users, some verification methods are supported by the specification. The methods all use a common framework for negotiating the key verification.

To use this framework, Alice's client would send =m.key.verification.request= events to Bob's devices. All of the =to_device= messages sent to Bob MUST have the same =transaction_id= to indicate they are part of the same request. This allows Bob to reject the request on one device, and have it apply to all of his devices. Similarly, it allows Bob to process the verification on one device without having to involve all of his devices.

When Bob's device receives a =m.key.verification.request=, it should prompt Bob to verify keys with Alice using one of the supported methods in the request. If Bob's device does not understand any of the methods, it should not cancel the request as one of his other devices may support the request. Instead, Bob's device should tell Bob that an unsupported method was used for starting key verification. The prompt for Bob to accept/reject Alice's request (or the unsupported method prompt) should be automatically dismissed 10 minutes after the =timestamp= field or 2 minutes after Bob's client receives the message, whichever comes first, if Bob does not interact with the prompt. The prompt should additionally be hidden if an appropriate =m.key.verification.cancel= message is received.

If Bob rejects the request, Bob's client must send a =m.key.verification.cancel= message to Alice's device. Upon receipt, Alice's device should tell her that Bob does not want to verify her device and send =m.key.verification.cancel= messages to all of Bob's devices to notify them that the request was rejected.

If Bob accepts the request, Bob's device starts the key verification process by sending a =m.key.verification.start= message to Alice's device. Upon receipt of this message, Alice's device should send a =m.key.verification.cancel= message to all of Bob's other devices to indicate the process has been started. The start message must use the same =transaction_id= from the original key verification request if it is in response to the request. The start message can be sent indepdently of any request.

Individual verification methods may add additional steps, events, and properties to the verification messages. Event types for methods defined in this specification must be under the =m.key.verification= namespace and any other event types must be namespaced according to the Java package naming convention.

Any of Alice's or Bob's devices can cancel the key verification request or process at any time with a =m.key.verification.cancel= message to all applicable devices.

This framework yields the following handshake, assuming both Alice and Bob each have 2 devices, Bob's first device accepts the key verification request, and Alice's second device initiates the request. Note how Alice's first device is not involved in the request or verification process.

**** [[#id438][13.11.2.2   Short Authentication String (SAS) verification]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: short-authentication-string-sas-verification
:END:

SAS verification is a user-friendly key verification process built off the common framework outlined above. SAS verification is intended to be a highly interactive process for users, and as such exposes verfiication methods which are easier for users to use.

The verification process is heavily inspired by Phil Zimmermann's ZRTP key agreement handshake. A key part of key agreement in ZRTP is the hash commitment: the party that begins the Diffie-Hellman key sharing sends a hash of their part of the Diffie-Hellman exchange, and does not send their part of the Diffie-Hellman exchange until they have received the other party's part. Thus an attacker essentially only has one attempt to attack the Diffie-Hellman exchange, and hence we can verify fewer bits while still achieving a high degree of security: if we verify n bits, then an attacker has a 1 in 2^{n} chance of success. For example, if we verify 40 bits, then an attacker has a 1 in 1,099,511,627,776 chance (or less than 1 in 10^{12} chance) of success. A failed attack would result in a mismatched Short Authentication String, alerting users to the attack.

The verification process takes place over [[#to-device][to-device]] messages in two phases:

1. Key agreement phase (based on [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6189#section-4.4.1][ZRTP key agreement]]).
2. Key verification phase (based on HMAC).

The process between Alice and Bob verifying each other would be:

1.  Alice and Bob establish a secure out-of-band connection, such as meeting in-person or a video call. "Secure" here means that either party cannot be impersonated, not explicit secrecy.
2.  Alice and Bob communicate which devices they'd like to verify with each other.
3.  Alice selects Bob's device from the device list and begins verification.
4.  Alice's client ensures it has a copy of Bob's device key.
5.  Alice's device sends Bob's device a =m.key.verification.start= message.
6.  Bob's device receives the message and selects a key agreement protocol, hash algorithm, message authentication code, and SAS method supported by Alice's device.
7.  Bob's device ensures it has a copy of Alice's device key.
8.  Bob's device creates an ephemeral Curve25519 key pair (/K/^{/private/}_{/B/}, /K/^{/public/}_{/B/}), and calculates the hash (using the chosen algorithm) of the public key /K/^{/public/}_{/B/}.
9.  Bob's device replies to Alice's device with a =m.key.verification.accept= message.
10. Alice's device receives Bob's message and stores the commitment hash for later use.
11. Alice's device creates an ephemeral Curve25519 key pair (/K/^{/private/}_{/A/}, /K/^{/public/}_{/A/}) and replies to Bob's device with a =m.key.verification.key=, sending only the public key /K/^{/public/}_{/A/}.
12. Bob's device receives Alice's message and replies with its own =m.key.verification.key= message containing its public key /K/^{/public/}_{/B/}.
13. Alice's device receives Bob's message and verifies the commitment hash from earlier matches the hash of the key Bob's device just sent and the content of Alice's =m.key.verification.start= message.
14. Both Alice and Bob's devices perform an Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (/ECDH/(/K/^{/private/}_{/A/}, /K/^{/public/}_{/B/})), using the result as the shared secret.
15. Both Alice and Bob's devices display a SAS to their users, which is derived from the shared key using one of the methods in this section. If multiple SAS methods are available, clients should allow the users to select a method.
16. Alice and Bob compare the strings shown by their devices, and tell their devices if they match or not.
17. Assuming they match, Alice and Bob's devices calculate the HMAC of their own device keys and a comma-separated sorted list of of the key IDs that they wish the other user to verify, using SHA-256 as the hash function. HMAC is defined in [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104][RFC 2104]]. The key for the HMAC is different for each item and is calculated by generating 32 bytes (256 bits) using [[#sas-hkdf][the key verification HKDF]].
18. Alice's device sends Bob's device a =m.key.verification.mac= message containing the MAC of Alice's device keys and the MAC of her key IDs to be verified. Bob's device does the same for Bob's device keys and key IDs concurrently with Alice.
19. When the other device receives the =m.key.verification.mac= message, the device calculates the HMAC of its copies of the other device's keys given in the message, as well as the HMAC of the comma-seperated, sorted, list of key IDs in the message. The device compares these with the HMAC values given in the message, and if everything matches then the device keys are verified.

The wire protocol looks like the following between Alice and Bob's devices:

***** [[#id439][13.11.2.2.1   Error and exception handling]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: error-and-exception-handling
:END:

At any point the interactive verfication can go wrong. The following describes what to do when an error happens:

- Alice or Bob can cancel the verification at any time. A =m.key.verification.cancel= message must be sent to signify the cancellation.
- The verification can time out. Clients should time out a verification that does not complete within 10 minutes. Additionally, clients should expire a =transaction_id= which goes unused for 10 minutes after having last sent/received it. The client should inform the user that the verification timed out, and send an appropriate =m.key.verification.cancel= message to the other device.
- When the same device attempts to intiate multiple verification attempts, the receipient should cancel all attempts with that device.
- When a device receives an unknown =transaction_id=, it should send an appropriate =m.key.verfication.cancel= message to the other device indicating as such. This does not apply for inbound =m.key.verification.start= or =m.key.verification.cancel= messages.
- If the two devices do not share a common key share, hash, HMAC, or SAS method then the device should notify the other device with an appropriate =m.key.verification.cancel= message.
- If the user claims the Short Authentication Strings do not match, the device should send an appropriate =m.key.verification.cancel= message to the other device.
- If the device receives a message out of sequence or that it was not expecting, it should notify the other device with an appropriate =m.key.verification.cancel= message.

In all of the SAS methods, HKDF is as defined in [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869][RFC 5869]] and uses the previously agreed-upon hash function for the hash function. The shared secret is supplied as the input keying material. No salt is used, and the info parameter is the concatenation of:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  - The string =MATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_SAS=.
  - The Matrix ID of the user who sent the =m.key.verification.start= message.
  - The Device ID of the device which sent the =m.key.verification.start= message.

#+END_QUOTE

Rationale

HKDF is used over the plain shared secret as it results in a harder attack as well as more uniform data to work with.

For verification of each party's device keys, HKDF is as defined in RFC 5869 and uses SHA-256 as the hash function. The shared secret is supplied as the input keying material. No salt is used, and in the info parameter is the concatenation of:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  - The string =MATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_MAC=.
  - The Matrix ID of the user whose key is being MAC-ed.
  - The Device ID of the device sending the MAC.
  - The Matrix ID of the other user.

Generate 5 bytes using [[#sas-hkdf][HKDF]] then take sequences of 13 bits to convert to decimal numbers (resulting in 3 numbers between 0 and 8191 inclusive each). Add 1000 to each calculated number.

The bitwise operations to get the numbers given the 5 bytes /B/_{0}, /B/_{1}, /B/_{2}, /B/_{3}, /B/_{4} would be:

- First: (/B/_{0}≪5|/B/_{1}≫3) + 1000
- Second: ((/B/_{1}&0/x/7)≪10|/B/_{2}≪2|/B/_{3}≫6) + 1000

Note

This table is available as JSON at [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/data-definitions/sas-emoji.json]]

Rationale

The emoji above were chosen to:

- Be recognisable without colour.
- Be recognisable at a small size.
- Be recognisable by most cultures.
- Be distinguishable from each other.
- Easily described by a few words.
- Avoid symbols with negative connotations.
- Be likely similar across multiple platforms.

Clients SHOULD show the emoji with the descriptions from the table, or appropriate translation of those descriptions. Client authors SHOULD collaborate to create a common set of translations for all languages.

*** [[#id448][13.11.3   Sharing keys between devices]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sharing-keys-between-devices
:END:

If Bob has an encrypted conversation with Alice on his computer, and then logs in through his phone for the first time, he may want to have access to the previously exchanged messages. To address this issue, several methods are provided to allow users to transfer keys from one device to another.

**** [[#id449][13.11.3.1   Key requests]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-requests
:END:

When a device is missing keys to decrypt messages, it can request the keys by sending [[#m-room-key-request][m.room\_key\_request]] to-device messages to other devices with =action= set to =request=. If a device wishes to share the keys with that device, it can forward the keys to the first device by sending an encrypted [[#m-forwarded-room-key][m.forwarded\_room\_key]] to-device message. The first device should then send an [[#m-room-key-request][m.room\_key\_request]] to-device message with =action= set to =request_cancellation= to the other devices that it had originally sent the key request to; a device that receives a =request_cancellation= should disregard any previously-received =request= message with the same =request_id= and =requesting_device_id=.

Note

Key sharing can be a big attack vector, thus it must be done very carefully. A reasonable strategy is for a user's client to only send keys requested by the verified devices of the same user.

**** [[#id450][13.11.3.2   Key exports]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-exports
:END:

Keys can be manually exported from one device to an encrypted file, copied to another device, and imported. The file is encrypted using a user-supplied passphrase, and is created as follows:

1. Encode the sessions as a JSON object, formatted as described in [[#key-export-format][Key export format]].

2. Generate a 512-bit key from the user-entered passphrase by computing [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898#section-5.2][PBKDF2]](HMAC-SHA-512, passphrase, S, N, 512), where S is a 128-bit cryptographically-random salt and N is the number of rounds. N should be at least 100,000. The keys K and K' are set to the first and last 256 bits of this generated key, respectively. K is used as an AES-256 key, and K' is used as an HMAC-SHA-256 key.

3. Serialize the JSON object as a UTF-8 string, and encrypt it using AES-CTR-256 with the key K generated above, and with a 128-bit cryptographically-random initialization vector, IV, that has bit 63 set to zero. (Setting bit 63 to zero in IV is needed to work around differences in implementations of AES-CTR.)

4. Concatenate the following data:

   | Size (bytes)   | Description                                                                            |

   | 16             | The salt S.                                                                            |

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: messaging-algorithm-names
:END:

Messaging algorithm names use the extensible naming scheme used throughout this specification. Algorithm names that start with =m.= are reserved for algorithms defined by this specification. Implementations wanting to experiment with new algorithms must be uniquely globally namespaced following Java's package naming conventions.

Algorithm names should be short and meaningful, and should list the primitives used by the algorithm so that it is easier to see if the algorithm is using a broken primitive.

A name of =m.olm.v1= is too short: it gives no information about the primitives in use, and is difficult to extend for different primitives. However a name of =m.olm.v1.ecdh-curve25519-hdkfsha256.hmacsha256.hkdfsha256-aes256-cbc-hmac64sha256= is too long despite giving a more precise description of the algorithm: it adds to the data transfer overhead and sacrifices clarity for human readers without adding any useful extra information.

**** [[#id454][13.11.4.2   =m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2
:END:

The name =m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2= corresponds to version 1 of the Olm ratchet, as defined by the [[http://matrix.org/docs/spec/olm.html][Olm specification]]. This uses:

- Curve25519 for the initial key agreement.
- HKDF-SHA-256 for ratchet key derivation.
- Curve25519 for the root key ratchet.
- HMAC-SHA-256 for the chain key ratchet.
- HKDF-SHA-256, AES-256 in CBC mode, and 8 byte truncated HMAC-SHA-256 for authenticated encryption.

Devices that support Olm must include "m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2" in their list of supported messaging algorithms, must list a Curve25519 device key, and must publish Curve25519 one-time keys.

An event encrypted using Olm has the following format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.room.encrypted",
  "content": {
  "algorithm": "m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2",
  "sender_key": "<sender_curve25519_key>",
  "ciphertext": {
  "<device_curve25519_key>": {
  "type": 0,
  "body": "<encrypted_payload_base_64>"
  }
  }
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

=ciphertext= is a mapping from device Curve25519 key to an encrypted payload for that device. =body= is a Base64-encoded Olm message body. =type= is an integer indicating the type of the message body: 0 for the initial pre-key message, 1 for ordinary messages.

Olm sessions will generate messages with a type of 0 until they receive a message. Once a session has decrypted a message it will produce messages with a type of 1.

When a client receives a message with a type of 0 it must first check if it already has a matching session. If it does then it will use that session to try to decrypt the message. If there is no existing session then the client must create a new session and use the new session to decrypt the message. A client must not persist a session or remove one-time keys used by a session until it has successfully decrypted a message using that session.

Messages with type 1 can only be decrypted with an existing session. If there is no matching session, the client must treat this as an invalid message.

The plaintext payload is of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "<type of the plaintext event>",
  "content": "<content for the plaintext event>",
  "sender": "<sender_user_id>",
  "recipient": "<recipient_user_id>",
  "recipient_keys": {
  "ed25519": "<our_ed25519_key>"
  },
  "keys": {
  "ed25519": "<sender_ed25519_key>"
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The type and content of the plaintext message event are given in the payload.

Other properties are included in order to prevent an attacker from publishing someone else's curve25519 keys as their own and subsequently claiming to have sent messages which they didn't. =sender= must correspond to the user who sent the event, =recipient= to the local user, and =recipient_keys= to the local ed25519 key.

Clients must confirm that the =sender_key= and the =ed25519= field value under the =keys= property match the keys returned by [[#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-query][=/keys/query=]] for the given user, and must also verify the signature of the payload. Without this check, a client cannot be sure that the sender device owns the private part of the ed25519 key it claims to have in the Olm payload. This is crucial when the ed25519 key corresponds to a verified device.

If a client has multiple sessions established with another device, it should use the session from which it last received and successfully decrypted a message. For these purposes, a session that has not received any messages should use its creation time as the time that it last received a message. A client may expire old sessions by defining a maximum number of olm sessions that it will maintain for each device, and expiring sessions on a Least Recently Used basis. The maximum number of olm sessions maintained per device should be at least 4.

***** [[#id455][13.11.4.2.1   Recovering from undecryptable messages]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: recovering-from-undecryptable-messages
:END:

Occasionally messages may be undecryptable by clients due to a variety of reasons. When this happens to an Olm-encrypted message, the client should assume that the Olm session has become corrupted and create a new one to replace it.

Note

Megolm-encrypted messages generally do not have the same problem. Usually the key for an undecryptable Megolm-encrypted message will come later, allowing the client to decrypt it successfully. Olm does not have a way to recover from the failure, making this session replacement process required.

To establish a new session, the client sends a [[#m-dummy][m.dummy]] to-device event to the other party to notify them of the new session details.

Clients should rate-limit the number of sessions it creates per device that it receives a message from. Clients should not create a new session with another device if it has already created one for that given device in the past 1 hour.

Clients should attempt to mitigate loss of the undecryptable messages. For example, Megolm sessions that were sent using the old session would have been lost. The client can attempt to retrieve the lost sessions through =m.room_key_request= messages.

**** [[#id456][13.11.4.3   =m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2
:END:

The name =m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2= corresponds to version 1 of the Megolm ratchet, as defined by the [[http://matrix.org/docs/spec/megolm.html][Megolm specification]]. This uses:

- HMAC-SHA-256 for the hash ratchet.
- HKDF-SHA-256, AES-256 in CBC mode, and 8 byte truncated HMAC-SHA-256 for authenticated encryption.
- Ed25519 for message authenticity.

Devices that support Megolm must support Olm, and include "m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2" in their list of supported messaging algorithms.

An event encrypted using Megolm has the following format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "m.room.encrypted",
  "content": {
  "algorithm": "m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2",
  "sender_key": "<sender_curve25519_key>",
  "device_id": "<sender_device_id>",
  "session_id": "<outbound_group_session_id>",
  "ciphertext": "<encrypted_payload_base_64>"
  }
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

The encrypted payload can contain any message event. The plaintext is of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "type": "<event_type>",
  "content": "<event_content>",
  "room_id": "<the room_id>"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

We include the room ID in the payload, because otherwise the homeserver would be able to change the room a message was sent in.

Clients must guard against replay attacks by keeping track of the ratchet indices of Megolm sessions. They should reject messages with a ratchet index that they have already decrypted. Care should be taken in order to avoid false positives, as a client may decrypt the same event twice as part of its normal processing.

As with Olm events, clients must confirm that the =sender_key= belongs to the user who sent the message. The same reasoning applies, but the sender ed25519 key has to be inferred from the =keys.ed25519= property of the event which established the Megolm session.

In order to enable end-to-end encryption in a room, clients can send a =m.room.encryption= state event specifying =m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2= as its =algorithm= property.

When creating a Megolm session in a room, clients must share the corresponding session key using Olm with the intended recipients, so that they can decrypt future messages encrypted using this session. A =m.room_key= event is used to do this. Clients must also handle =m.room_key= events sent by other devices in order to decrypt their messages.

:END:

This event type is used to indicate new Olm sessions for end-to-end encryption. Typically it is encrypted as an =m.room.encrypted= event, then sent as a [[#to-device][to-device]] event.

The event does not have any content associated with it. The sending client is expected to send a key share request shortly after this message, causing the receiving client to process this =m.dummy= event as the most recent event and using the keyshare request to set up the session. The keyshare request and =m.dummy= combination should result in the original sending client receiving keys over the newly established session.

Note

For optimal performance, Alice should be added to =changed= in Bob's sync only when she adds a new device, or when Alice and Bob now share a room but didn't share any room previously.

** [[#id471][13.12   Room History Visibility]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: room-history-visibility
:END:

This module adds support for controlling the visibility of previous events in a room.

In all cases except =world_readable=, a user needs to join a room to view events in that room. Once they have joined a room, they will gain access to a subset of events in the room. How this subset is chosen is controlled by the =m.room.history_visibility= event outlined below. After a user has left a room, they may see any events which they were allowed to see before they left the room, but no events received after they left.

The four options for the =m.room.history_visibility= event are:

- =world_readable= - All events while this is the =m.room.history_visibility= value may be shared by any participating homeserver with anyone, regardless of whether they have ever joined the room.
- =shared= - Previous events are always accessible to newly joined members. All events in the room are accessible, even those sent when the member was not a part of the room.
- =invited= - Events are accessible to newly joined members from the point they were invited onwards. Events stop being accessible when the member's state changes to something other than =invite= or =join=.
- =joined= - Events are accessible to newly joined members from the point they joined the room onwards. Events stop being accessible when the member's state changes to something other than =join=.

Warning

These options are applied at the point an event is /sent/. Checks are performed with the state of the =m.room.history_visibility= event when the event in question is added to the DAG. This means clients cannot retrospectively choose to show or hide history to new users if the setting at that time was more restrictive.

*** [[#id474][13.12.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-10
:END:

Clients that implement this module MUST present to the user the possible options for setting history visibility when creating a room.

Clients may want to display a notice that their events may be read by non-joined people if the value is set to =world_readable=.

*** [[#id475][13.12.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-5
:END:

By default if no =history_visibility= is set, or if the value is not understood, the visibility is assumed to be =shared=. The rules governing whether a user is allowed to see an event depend on the state of the room /at that event/.

1. If the =history_visibility= was set to =world_readable=, allow.
2. If the user's =membership= was =join=, allow.
3. If =history_visibility= was set to =shared=, and the user joined the room at any point after the event was sent, allow.
4. If the user's =membership= was =invite=, and the =history_visibility= was set to =invited=, allow.
5. Otherwise, deny.

For =m.room.history_visibility= events themselves, the user should be allowed to see the event if the =history_visibility= before /or/ after the event would allow them to see it. (For example, a user should be able to see =m.room.history_visibility= events which change the =history_visibility= from =world_readable= to =joined= /or/ from =joined= to =world_readable=, even if that user was not a member of the room.)

Likewise, for the user's own =m.room.member= events, the user should be allowed to see the event if their =membership= before /or/ after the event would allow them to see it. (For example, a user can always see =m.room.member= events which set their membership to =join=, or which change their membership from =join= to any other value, even if =history_visibility= is =joined=.)

*** [[#id476][13.12.4   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-7
:END:

The default value for =history_visibility= is =shared= for backwards-compatibility reasons. Clients need to be aware that by not setting this event they are exposing all of their room history to anyone in the room.

#+END_EXAMPLE

This module adds support for push notifications. Homeservers send notifications of events to user-configured HTTP endpoints. Users may also configure a number of rules that determine which events generate notifications. These are all stored and managed by the user's homeserver. This allows user-specific push settings to be reused between client applications.

The above diagram shows the flow of push notifications being sent to a handset where push notifications are submitted via the handset vendor, such as Apple's APNS or Google's GCM. This happens as follows:

1. The client app signs in to a homeserver.
2. The client app registers with its vendor's Push Provider and obtains a routing token of some kind.
3. The mobile app uses the Client/Server API to add a 'pusher', providing the URL of a specific Push Gateway which is configured for that application. It also provides the routing token it has acquired from the Push Provider.
4. The homeserver starts sending HTTP requests to the Push Gateway using the supplied URL. The Push Gateway relays this notification to the Push Provider, passing the routing token along with any necessary private credentials the provider requires to send push notifications.
5. The Push Provider sends the notification to the device.

Definitions for terms used in this section are below:

- Push Provider :: A push provider is a service managed by the device vendor which can send notifications directly to the device. Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) are two examples of push providers.
- Push Gateway :: A push gateway is a server that receives HTTP event notifications from homeservers and passes them on to a different protocol such as APNS for iOS devices or GCM for Android devices. Clients inform the homeserver which Push Gateway to send notifications to when it sets up a Pusher.

- Pusher :: A pusher is a worker on the homeserver that manages the sending of HTTP notifications for a user. A user can have multiple pushers: one per device.
- Push Rule :: A push rule is a single rule that states under what /conditions/ an event should be passed onto a push gateway and /how/ the notification should be presented. These rules are stored on the user's homeserver. They are manually configured by the user, who can create and view them via the Client/Server API.
- Push Ruleset :: A push ruleset /scopes a set of rules according to some criteria/. For example, some rules may only be applied for messages from a particular sender, a particular room, or by default. The push ruleset contains the entire set of scopes and rules.

**** [[#id483][13.13.1.4   Receiving notifications]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: receiving-notifications
:END:

Servers MUST include the number of unread notifications in a client's =/sync= stream, and MUST update it as it changes. Notifications are determined by the push rules which apply to an event.

When the user updates their read receipt (either by using the API or by sending an event), notifications prior to and including that event MUST be marked as read.

**** [[#id484][13.13.1.5   Push Rules]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: push-rules
:END:

A push rule is a single rule that states under what /conditions/ an event should be passed onto a push gateway and /how/ the notification should be presented. There are different "kinds" of push rules and each rule has an associated priority. Every push rule MUST have a =kind= and =rule_id=. The =rule_id= is a unique string within the kind of rule and its' scope: =rule_ids= do not need to be unique between rules of the same kind on different devices. Rules may have extra keys depending on the value of =kind=. The different kinds of rule in descending order of priority are:

- Override Rules =override= :: The highest priority rules are user-configured overrides.
- Content-specific Rules =content= :: These configure behaviour for (unencrypted) messages that match certain patterns. Content rules take one parameter: =pattern=, that gives the glob pattern to match against. This is treated in the same way as =pattern= for =event_match=.
- Room-specific Rules =room= :: These rules change the behaviour of all messages for a given room. The =rule_id= of a room rule is always the ID of the room that it affects.
- Sender-specific rules =sender= :: These rules configure notification behaviour for messages from a specific Matrix user ID. The =rule_id= of Sender rules is always the Matrix user ID of the user whose messages they'd apply to.
- Underride rules =underride= :: These are identical to =override= rules, but have a lower priority than =content=, =room= and =sender= rules.

This means that the full list of rule kinds, in descending priority order, is as follows:

- Global Override
- Global Content
- Global Room
- Global Sender
- Global Underride

Rules with the same =kind= can specify an ordering priority. This determines which rule is selected in the event of multiple matches. For example, a rule matching "tea" and a separate rule matching "time" would both match the sentence "It's time for tea". The ordering of the rules would then resolve the tiebreak to determine which rule is executed. Only =actions= for highest priority rule will be sent to the Push Gateway.

Each rule can be enabled or disabled. Disabled rules never match. If no rules match an event, the homeserver MUST NOT notify the Push Gateway for that event. Homeservers MUST NOT notify the Push Gateway for events that the user has sent themselves.

***** [[#id485][13.13.1.5.1   Actions]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: actions
:END:

All rules have an associated list of =actions=. An action affects if and how a notification is delivered for a matching event. The following actions are defined:

- =notify= :: This causes each matching event to generate a notification.
- =dont_notify= :: This prevents each matching event from generating a notification
- =coalesce= :: This enables notifications for matching events but activates homeserver specific behaviour to intelligently coalesce multiple events into a single notification. Not all homeservers may support this. Those that do not support it should treat it as the =notify= action.
- =set_tweak= :: Sets an entry in the =tweaks= dictionary key that is sent in the notification request to the Push Gateway. This takes the form of a dictionary with a =set_tweak= key whose value is the name of the tweak to set. It may also have a =value= key which is the value to which it should be set.

Actions that have no parameters are represented as a string. Otherwise, they are represented as a dictionary with a key equal to their name and other keys as their parameters, e.g. ={ "set_tweak": "sound", "value": "default" }=

****** [[#id486][13.13.1.5.1.1   Tweaks]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tweaks
:END:

The =set_tweak= action is used to add an entry to the 'tweaks' dictionary that is sent in the notification request to the Push Gateway. The following tweaks are defined:

- =sound= :: A string representing the sound to be played when this notification arrives. A value of =default= means to play a default sound. A device may choose to alert the user by some other means if appropriate, eg. vibration.
- =highlight= :: A boolean representing whether or not this message should be highlighted in the UI. This will normally take the form of presenting the message in a different colour and/or style. The UI might also be adjusted to draw particular attention to the room in which the event occurred. If a =highlight= tweak is given with no value, its value is defined to be =true=. If no highlight tweak is given at all then the value of =highlight= is defined to be false.

Tweaks are passed transparently through the homeserver so client applications and Push Gateways may agree on additional tweaks. For example, a tweak may be added to specify how to flash the notification light on a mobile device.

***** [[#id487][13.13.1.5.2   Predefined Rules]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: predefined-rules
:END:

Homeservers can specify "server-default rules" which operate at a lower priority than "user-defined rules". The =rule_id= for all server-default rules MUST start with a dot (".") to identify them as "server-default". The following server-default rules are specified:

***** [[#id504][13.13.1.5.3   Conditions]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: conditions
:END:

Override, Underride and Default Rules MAY have a list of 'conditions'. All conditions must hold true for an event in order to apply the =action= for the event. A rule with no conditions always matches. Room, Sender, User and Content rules do not have conditions in the same way, but instead have predefined conditions. These conditions can be configured using the parameters outlined below. In the cases of room and sender rules, the =rule_id= of the rule determines its behaviour. The following conditions are defined:

- =event_match= :: This is a glob pattern match on a field of the event. Parameters:

  - =key=: The dot-separated field of the event to match, e.g. =content.body=
  - =pattern=: The glob-style pattern to match against. Patterns with no special glob characters should be treated as having asterisks prepended and appended when testing the condition.

- =contains_display_name= :: This matches unencrypted messages where =content.body= contains the owner's display name in that room. This is a separate rule because display names may change and as such it would be hard to maintain a rule that matched the user's display name. This condition has no parameters.
- =room_member_count= :: This matches the current number of members in the room. Parameters:

  - =is=: A decimal integer optionally prefixed by one of, ====, =<=, =>=, =>== or =<==. A prefix of =<= matches rooms where the member count is strictly less than the given number and so forth. If no prefix is present, this parameter defaults to ====.

- =sender_notification_permission= :: This takes into account the current power levels in the room, ensuring the sender of the event has high enough power to trigger the notification.

  Parameters:

  - =key=: A string that determines the power level the sender must have to trigger notifications of a given type, such as =room=. Refer to the [[#m-room-power-levels][m.room.power\_levels]] event schema for information about what the defaults are and how to interpret the event. The =key= is used to look up the power level required to send a notification type from the =notifications= object in the power level event content.

Unrecognised conditions MUST NOT match any events, effectively making the push rule disabled.

**** [[#id519][13.13.3.1   Recommendations for APNS]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: recommendations-for-apns
:END:

The exact format for sending APNS notifications is flexible and up to the client app and its' push gateway to agree on. As APNS requires that the sender has a private key owned by the app developer, each app must have its own push gateway. It is recommended that:

- The APNS token be base64 encoded and used as the pushkey.
- A different app\_id be used for apps on the production and sandbox APS environments.
- APNS push gateways do not attempt to wait for errors from the APNS gateway before returning and instead to store failures and return 'rejected' responses next time that pushkey is used.

*** [[#id520][13.13.4   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-8
:END:

Clients specify the Push Gateway URL to use to send event notifications to. This URL should be over HTTPS and /never/ over HTTP.

As push notifications will pass through a Push Provider, message content shouldn't be sent in the push itself where possible. Instead, Push Gateways should send a "sync" command to instruct the client to get new events from the homeserver directly.

** [[#id521][13.14   Third party invites]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: third-party-invites
:END:

This module adds in support for inviting new members to a room where their Matrix user ID is not known, instead addressing them by a third party identifier such as an email address. There are two flows here; one if a Matrix user ID is known for the third party identifier, and one if not. Either way, the client calls =/invite= with the details of the third party identifier.

The homeserver asks the identity server whether a Matrix user ID is known for that identifier:

- If it is, an invite is simply issued for that user.
- If it is not, the homeserver asks the identity server to record the details of the invitation, and to notify the invitee's homeserver of this pending invitation if it gets a binding for this identifier in the future. The identity server returns a token and public key to the inviting homeserver.

When the invitee's homeserver receives the notification of the binding, it should insert an =m.room.member= event into the room's graph for that user, with =content.membership= = =invite=, as well as a =content.third_party_invite= property which contains proof that the invitee does indeed own that third party identifier. See the [[#m-room-member][m.room.member]] schema for more information.

:CUSTOM_ID: post-_matrixclientr0roomsroomidinvite-1
:END:

/Note that there are two forms of this API, which are documented separately. This version of the API does not require that the inviter know the Matrix identifier of the invitee, and instead relies on third party identifiers. The homeserver uses an identity server to perform the mapping from third party identifier to a Matrix identifier. The other is documented in the/ [[#invite-by-user-id-endpoint][joining rooms section]].

This API invites a user to participate in a particular room. They do not start participating in the room until they actually join the room.

Only users currently in a particular room can invite other users to join that room.

If the identity server did know the Matrix user identifier for the third party identifier, the homeserver will append a =m.room.member= event to the room.

If the identity server does not know a Matrix user identifier for the passed third party identifier, the homeserver will issue an invitation which can be accepted upon providing proof of ownership of the third party identifier. This is achieved by the identity server generating a token, which it gives to the inviting homeserver. The homeserver will add an =m.room.third_party_invite= event into the graph for the room, containing that token.

When the invitee binds the invited third party identifier to a Matrix user ID, the identity server will give the user a list of pending invitations, each containing:

- The room ID to which they were invited
- The token given to the homeserver
- A signature of the token, signed with the identity server's private key
- The matrix user ID who invited them to the room

If a token is requested from the identity server, the homeserver will append a =m.room.third_party_invite= event to the room.

/JSON body parameters/

id\_server

string

*Required.* The hostname+port of the identity server which should be used for third party identifier lookups.

id\_access\_token

string

*Required.* An access token previously registered with the identity server. Servers can treat this as optional to distinguish between r0.5-compatible clients and this specification version.

Responses:

*Status code 200:*

The user has been invited to join the room.

Example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {}
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Status code 403:*

You do not have permission to invite the user to the room. A meaningful =errcode= and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejections are:

- The invitee has been banned from the room.
- The invitee is already a member of the room.
- The inviter is not currently in the room.
- The inviter's power level is insufficient to invite users to the room.

Example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN",
  "error": "@cheeky_monkey:matrix.org is banned from the room"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Status code 429:*

This request was rate-limited.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-7
:END:

Upon receipt of an =/invite=, the server is expected to look up the third party identifier with the provided identity server. If the lookup yields a result for a Matrix User ID then the normal invite process can be initiated. This process ends up looking like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  +---------+ +-------------+ +-----------------+
  | Client | | Homeserver | | IdentityServer |
  +---------+ +-------------+ +-----------------+
  | | |
  | POST /invite | |

  | | GET /lookup |

  | |------------------------------------------ |
  | | | |
  | |<----------------------------------------- |
  | | |
  | Complete the /invite request | |
  |<------------------------------------| |
  | | |
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, if the lookup does not yield a bound User ID, the homeserver must store the invite on the identity server and emit a valid =m.room.third_party_invite= event to the room. This process ends up looking like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  +---------+ +-------------+ +-----------------+
  | Client | | Homeserver | | IdentityServer |
  +---------+ +-------------+ +-----------------+
  | | |
  | POST /invite | |

#+END_EXAMPLE

All homeservers MUST verify the signature in the event's =content.third_party_invite.signed= object.

The third party user will then need to verify their identity, which results in a call from the identity server to the homeserver that bound the third party identifier to a user. The homeserver then exchanges the =m.room.third_party_invite= event in the room for a complete =m.room.member= event for =membership: invite= for the user that has bound the third party identifier.

If a homeserver is joining a room for the first time because of an =m.room.third_party_invite=, the server which is already participating in the room (which is chosen as per the standard server-server specification) MUST validate that the public key used for signing is still valid, by checking =key_validity_url= in the above described way.

No other homeservers may reject the joining of the room on the basis of =key_validity_url=, this is so that all homeservers have a consistent view of the room. They may, however, indicate to their clients that a member's membership is questionable.

For example, given H1, H2, and H3 as homeservers, UserA as a user of H1, and an identity server IS, the full sequence for a third party invite would look like the following. This diagram assumes H1 and H2 are residents of the room while H3 is attempting to join.

#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that when H1 sends the =m.room.member= event to H2 and H3 it does not have to block on either server's receipt of the event. Likewise, H1 may complete the =/exchange_third_party_invite/:roomId= request at the same time as sending the =m.room.member= event to H2 and H3. Additionally, H3 may complete the =/3pid/onbind= request it got from IS at any time - the completion is not shown in the diagram.

H1 MUST verify the request from H3 to ensure the =signed= property is correct as well as the =key_validity_url= as still being valid. This is done by making a request to the [[../identity_service/r0.3.0.html#get-matrix-identity-v2-pubkey-isvalid][identity server /isvalid]] endpoint, using the provided URL rather than constructing a new one. The query string and response for the provided URL must match the Identity Service Specification.

The reason that no other homeserver may reject the event based on checking =key_validity_url= is that we must ensure event acceptance is deterministic. If some other participating server doesn't have a network path to the keyserver, or if the keyserver were to go offline, or revoke its keys, that other server would reject the event and cause the participating servers' graphs to diverge. This relies on participating servers trusting each other, but that trust is already implied by the server-server protocol. Also, the public key signature verification must still be performed, so the attack surface here is minimized.

*** [[#id527][13.14.4   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-9
:END:

There are a number of privacy and trust implications to this module.

It is important for user privacy that leaking the mapping between a matrix user ID and a third party identifier is hard. In particular, being able to look up all third party identifiers from a matrix user ID (and accordingly, being able to link each third party identifier) should be avoided wherever possible. To this end, the third party identifier is not put in any event, rather an opaque display name provided by the identity server is put into the events. Clients should not remember or display third party identifiers from invites, other than for the use of the inviter themself.

Homeservers are not required to trust any particular identity server(s). It is generally a client's responsibility to decide which identity servers it trusts, not a homeserver's. Accordingly, this API takes identity servers as input from end users, and doesn't have any specific trusted set. It is possible some homeservers may want to supply defaults, or reject some identity servers for /its/ users, but no homeserver is allowed to dictate which identity servers /other/ homeservers' users trust.

There is some risk of denial of service attacks by flooding homeservers or identity servers with many requests, or much state to store. Defending against these is left to the implementer's discretion.

*** [[#id531][13.15.2   Search Categories]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: search-categories
:END:

The search API allows clients to search in different categories of items. Currently the only specified category is =room_events=.

**** [[#id532][13.15.2.1   =room_events=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: room_events
:END:

This category covers all events that the user is allowed to see, including events in rooms that they have left. The search is performed on certain keys of certain event types.

The supported keys to search over are:

- =content.body= in =m.room.message=
- =content.name= in =m.room.name=
- =content.topic= in =m.room.topic=

The search will /not/ include rooms that are end to end encrypted.

The results include a =rank= key that can be used to sort the results by relevancy. The higher the =rank= the more relevant the result is.

The value of =count= gives an approximation of the total number of results. Homeservers may give an estimate rather than an exact value for this field.

*** [[#id533][13.15.3   Ordering]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ordering
:END:

The client can specify the ordering that the server returns results in. The two allowed orderings are:

- =rank=, which returns the most relevant results first.
- =recent=, which returns the most recent results first.

The default ordering is =rank=.

*** [[#id534][13.15.4   Groups]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: groups
:END:

The client can request that the results are returned along with grouping information, e.g. grouped by =room_id=. In this case the response will contain a group entry for each distinct value of =room_id=. Each group entry contains at least a list of the =event_ids= that are in that group, as well as potentially other metadata about the group.

The current required supported groupings are:

- =room_id=
- =sender=

*** [[#id535][13.15.5   Pagination]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pagination-1
:END:

The server may return a =next_batch= key at various places in the response. These are used to paginate the results. To fetch more results, the client should send the /same/ request to the server with a =next_batch= query parameter set to that of the token.

The scope of the pagination is defined depending on where the =next_batch= token was returned. For example, using a token inside a group will return more results from within that group.

The currently supported locations for the =next_batch= token are:

- =search_categories.<category>.next_batch=
- =search_categories.<category>.groups.<group_key>.<group_id>.next_batch=

A server need not support pagination, even if there are more matching results. In that case, they must not return a =next_batch= token in the response.

*** [[#id536][13.15.6   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-10
:END:

The server must only return results that the user has permission to see.

** [[#id537][13.16   Guest Access]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: guest-access
:END:

There are times when it is desirable for clients to be able to interact with rooms without having to fully register for an account on a homeserver or join the room. This module specifies how these clients should interact with servers in order to participate in rooms as guests.

Guest users retrieve access tokens from a homeserver using the ordinary [[#post-matrix-client-r0-register][register endpoint]], specifying the =kind= parameter as =guest=. They may then interact with the client-server API as any other user would, but will only have access to a subset of the API as described the Client behaviour subsection below. Homeservers may choose not to allow this access at all to their local users, but have no information about whether users on other homeservers are guests or not.

Guest users can also upgrade their account by going through the ordinary =register= flow, but specifying the additional POST parameter =guest_access_token= containing the guest's access token. They are also required to specify the =username= parameter to the value of the local part of their username, which is otherwise optional.

This module does not fully factor in federation; it relies on individual homeservers properly adhering to the rules set out in this module, rather than allowing all homeservers to enforce the rules on each other.

*** [[#id541][13.16.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-8
:END:

Servers MUST only allow guest users to join rooms if the =m.room.guest_access= state event is present on the room, and has the =guest_access= value =can_join=. If the =m.room.guest_access= event is changed to stop this from being the case, the server MUST set those users' =m.room.member= state to =leave=.

*** [[#id542][13.16.4   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-11
:END:

Each homeserver manages its own guest accounts itself, and whether an account is a guest account or not is not information passed from server to server. Accordingly, any server participating in a room is trusted to properly enforce the permissions outlined in this section.

Homeservers may want to enable protections such as captchas for guest registration to prevent spam, denial of service, and similar attacks.

** [[#id543][13.17   Room Previews]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: room-previews
:END:

It is sometimes desirable to offer a preview of a room, where a user can "lurk" and read messages posted to the room, without joining the room. This can be particularly effective when combined with [[#guest-access][Guest Access]].

Previews are implemented via the =world_readable= [[#room-history-visibility][Room History Visibility]]. setting, along with a special version of the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-events][GET /events]] endpoint.

*** [[#id544][13.17.1   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-15
:END:

A client wishing to view a room without joining it should call [[#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-initialsync][GET /rooms/:room\_id/initialSync]], followed by [[#peeking-events-api][GET /events]]. Clients will need to do this in parallel for each room they wish to view.

Clients can of course also call other endpoints such as [[#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages][GET /rooms/:room\_id/messages]] and [[#get-matrix-client-r0-search][GET /search]] to access events outside the =/events= stream.

**** [[#id545][13.17.1.1   =GET /_matrix/client/r0/events=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: get-_matrixclientr0events

This will listen for new events related to a particular room and return them to the caller. This will block until an event is received, or until the =timeout= is reached.

This API is the same as the normal =/events= endpoint, but can be called by users who have not joined the room.

Note that the normal =/events= endpoint has been deprecated. This API will also be deprecated at some point, but its replacement is not yet known.

For clients which have not joined a room, servers are required to only return events where the room state at the event had the =m.room.history_visibility= state event present with =history_visibility= value =world_readable=.

*** [[#id547][13.17.3   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-12
:END:

Clients may wish to display to their users that rooms which are =world_readable= /may/ be showing messages to non-joined users. There is no way using this module to find out whether any non-joined guest users /do/ see events in the room, or to list or count any lurking users.

** [[#id548][13.18   Room Tagging]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: room-tagging
:END:

Users can add tags to rooms. Tags are namespaced strings used to label rooms. A room may have multiple tags. Tags are only visible to the user that set them but are shared across all their devices.

*** [[#id549][13.18.1   Events]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: events-12
:END:

The tags on a room are received as single =m.tag= event in the =account_data= section of a room. The content of the =m.tag= event is a =tags= key whose value is an object mapping the name of each tag to another object.

The JSON object associated with each tag gives information about the tag, e.g how to order the rooms with a given tag.

Ordering information is given under the =order= key as a number between 0 and 1. The numbers are compared such that 0 is displayed first. Therefore a room with an =order= of =0.2= would be displayed before a room with an =order= of =0.7=. If a room has a tag without an =order= key then it should appear after the rooms with that tag that have an =order= key.

The name of a tag MUST NOT exceed 255 bytes.

The tag namespace is defined as follows:

- The namespace =m.*= is reserved for tags defined in the Matrix specification. Clients must ignore any tags in this namespace they don't understand.
- The namespace =u.*= is reserved for user-defined tags. The portion of the string after the =u.= is defined to be the display name of this tag. No other semantics should be inferred from tags in this namespace.
- A client or app willing to use special tags for advanced functionality should namespace them similarly to state keys: =tld.name.*=
- Any tag in the =tld.name.*= form but not matching the namespace of the current client should be ignored
- Any tag not matching the above rules should be interpreted as a user tag from the =u.*= namespace, as if the name had already had =u.= stripped from the start (ie. the name of the tag is used as the display name directly). These non-namespaced tags are supported for historical reasons. New tags should use one of the defined namespaces above.

Several special names are listed in the specification: The following tags are defined in the =m.*= namespace:

- =m.favourite=: The user's favourite rooms. These should be shown with higher precedence than other rooms.
- =m.lowpriority=: These should be shown with lower precedence than others.
- =m.server_notice=: Used to identify [[#module-server-notices][Server Notice Rooms]].

The server must only return results that the user has permission to see.

** [[#id570][13.22   SSO client login]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sso-client-login
:END:

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a generic term which refers to protocols which allow users to log into applications via a single web-based authentication portal. Examples include "Central Authentication Service" (CAS) and SAML.

An overview of the process, as used in Matrix, is as follows:

1. The Matrix client instructs the user's browser to navigate to the [[#get-matrix-client-r0-login-sso-redirect][=/login/sso/redirect=]] endpoint on the user's homeserver.
2. The homeserver responds with an HTTP redirect to the SSO user interface, which the browser follows.
3. The SSO system authenticates the user.
4. The SSO server and the homeserver interact to verify the user's identity and other authentication information, potentially using a number of redirects.
5. The browser is directed to the =redirectUrl= provided by the client with a =loginToken= query parameter for the client to log in with.

Note

In the older [[https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#cas-based-client-login][r0.4.0 version]] of this specification it was possible to authenticate via CAS when the server provides a =m.login.cas= login flow. This specification deprecates the use of =m.login.cas= to instead prefer =m.login.sso=, which is the same process with the only change being which redirect endpoint to use: for =m.login.cas=, use =/cas/redirect= and for =m.login.sso= use =/sso/redirect= (described below). The endpoints are otherwise the same.

*** [[#id571][13.22.1   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-20
:END:

The client starts the process by instructing the browser to navigate to [[#get-matrix-client-r0-login-sso-redirect][=/login/sso/redirect=]] with an appropriate =redirectUrl=. Once authentication is successful, the browser will be redirected to that =redirectUrl=.

redirectUrl

string

*Required.* URI to which the user will be redirected after the homeserver has authenticated the user with SSO.

Example request:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

Response:

*Status code 302:*

A redirect to the SSO interface.

*** [[#id573][13.22.2   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-11
:END:

The URI for the SSO system to be used should be configured on the server by the server administrator. The server is expected to set up any endpoints required to interact with that SSO system. For example, for CAS authentication the homeserver should provide a means for the administrator to configure where the CAS server is and the REST endpoints which consume the ticket. A good reference for how CAS could be implemented is available in the older [[https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#cas-based-client-login][r0.4.0 version]] of this specification.

**** [[#id574][13.22.2.1   Handling the redirect endpoint]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: handling-the-redirect-endpoint
:END:

When responding to the =/login/sso/redirect= endpoint, the server must generate a URI for the SSO login page with any appropriate parameters.

**** [[#id575][13.22.2.2   Handling the authentication endpoint]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: handling-the-authentication-endpoint
:END:

Once the homeserver has verified the user's identity with the SSO system, it MUST map the user ID to a valid [[../index.html#user-identifiers][Matrix user identifier]]. The guidance in [[../index.html#mapping-from-other-character-sets][Mapping from other character sets]] may be useful.

If the generated user identifier represents a new user, it should be registered as a new user.

Finally, the server should generate a short-term login token. The generated token should be a macaroon, suitable for use with the =m.login.token= type of the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-login][=/login=]] API, and [[#token-based][token-based interactive login]]. The lifetime of this token SHOULD be limited to around five seconds. This token is given to the client via the =loginToken= query parameter previously mentioned.

** [[#id576][13.23   Direct Messaging]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: direct-messaging
:END:

All communication over Matrix happens within a room. It is sometimes desirable to offer users the concept of speaking directly to one particular person. This module defines a way of marking certain rooms as 'direct chats' with a given person. This does not restrict the chat to being between exactly two people since this would preclude the presence of automated 'bot' users or even a 'personal assistant' who is able to answer direct messages on behalf of the user in their absence.

A room may not necessarily be considered 'direct' by all members of the room, but a signalling mechanism exists to propagate the information of whether a chat is 'direct' to an invitee.

*** [[#id577][13.23.1   Events]]

:CUSTOM_ID: events-14
:END:

**** [[#id578][13.23.1.1   =m.direct=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.direct
:END:

A map of which rooms are considered 'direct' rooms for specific users is kept in =account_data= in an event of type =m.direct=. The content of this event is an object where the keys are the user IDs and values are lists of room ID strings of the 'direct' rooms for that user ID.

Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "content": {
  "@bob:example.com": [
  "!abcdefgh:example.com",
  "!hgfedcba:example.com"
  ]
  },
  "type": "m.direct"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** [[#id579][13.23.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-21
:END:

To start a direct chat with another user, the inviting user's client should set the =is_direct= flag to [[#post-matrix-client-r0-createroom][=/createRoom=]]. The client should do this whenever the flow the user has followed is one where their intention is to speak directly with another person, as opposed to bringing that person in to a shared room. For example, clicking on 'Start Chat' beside a person's profile picture would imply the =is_direct= flag should be set.

The invitee's client may use the =is_direct= flag in the [[#m-room-member][m.room.member]] event to automatically mark the room as a direct chat but this is not required: it may for example, prompt the user, or ignore the flag altogether.

Both the inviting client and the invitee's client should record the fact that the room is a direct chat by storing an =m.direct= event in the account data using [[#put-matrix-client-r0-user-userid-account-data-type][=/user/<user_id>/account_data/<type>=]].

*** [[#id580][13.23.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-12
:END:

When the =is_direct= flag is given to [[#post-matrix-client-r0-createroom][=/createRoom=]], the home server must set the =is_direct= flag in the invite member event for any users invited in the [[#post-matrix-client-r0-createroom][=/createRoom=]] call.

  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** [[#id584][13.24.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-22
:END:

To ignore a user, effectively blocking them, the client should add the target user to the =m.ignored_user_list= event in their account data using [[#put-matrix-client-r0-user-userid-account-data-type][=/user/<user_id>/account_data/<type>=]]. Once ignored, the client will no longer receive events sent by that user, with the exception of state events. The client should either hide previous content sent by the newly ignored user or perform a new =/sync= with no previous token.

Invites to new rooms by ignored users will not be sent to the client. The server may optionally reject the invite on behalf of the client.

State events will still be sent to the client, even if the user is ignored. This is to ensure parts, such as the room name, do not appear different to the user just because they ignored the sender.

To remove a user from the ignored users list, remove them from the account data event. The server will resume sending events from the previously ignored user, however it should not send events that were missed while the user was ignored. To receive the events that were sent while the user was ignored the client should perform a fresh sync. The client may also un-hide any events it previously hid due to the user becoming ignored.

*** [[#id585][13.24.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-13
:END:

Following an update of the =m.ignored_user_list=, the sync API for all clients should immediately start ignoring (or un-ignoring) the user. Clients are responsible for determining if they should hide previously sent events or to start a new sync stream.

Servers must still send state events sent by ignored users to clients.

Servers must not send room invites from ignored users to clients. Servers may optionally decide to reject the invite, however.

Sticker messages are specialised image messages that are displayed without controls (e.g. no "download" link, or light-box view on click, as would be displayed for for [[#m-image][m.image]] events).

Sticker messages are intended to provide simple "reaction" events in the message timeline. The matrix client should provide some mechanism to display the sticker "body" e.g. as a tooltip on hover, or in a modal when the sticker image is clicked.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: events-16

Sticker events are received as a single =m.sticker= event in the =timeline= section of a room, in a =/sync=.

*** [[#id589][13.25.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-23
:END:

Clients supporting this message type should display the image content from the event URL directly in the timeline.

A thumbnail image should be provided in the =info= object. This is largely intended as a fallback for clients that do not fully support the =m.sticker= event type. In most cases it is fine to set the thumbnail URL to the same URL as the main event content.

It is recommended that sticker image content should be 512x512 pixels in size or smaller. The dimensions of the image file should be twice the intended display size specified in the =info= object in order to assist rendering sharp images on higher DPI screens.

** [[#id590][13.26   Reporting Content]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reporting-content
:END:

Users may encounter content which they find inappropriate and should be able to report it to the server administrators or room moderators for review. This module defines a way for users to report content.

Content is reported based upon a negative score, where -100 is "most offensive" and 0 is "inoffensive".

Servers are free to handle the reported content however they desire. This may be a dedicated room to alert server administrators to the reported content or some other mechanism for notifying the appropriate people.

** [[#id594][13.27   Third Party Networks]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: third-party-networks
:END:

Application services can provide access to third party networks via bridging. This allows Matrix users to communicate with users on other communication platforms, with messages ferried back and forth by the application service. A single application service may bridge multiple third party networks, and many individual locations within those networks. A single third party network location may be bridged to multiple Matrix rooms.

** [[#id604][13.29   Server Access Control Lists (ACLs) for rooms]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-access-control-lists-acls-for-rooms
:END:

In some scenarios room operators may wish to prevent a malicious or untrusted server from participating in their room. Sending an [[#m-room-server-acl][m.room.server\_acl]] state event into a room is an effective way to prevent the server from participating in the room at the federation level.

Server ACLs can also be used to make rooms only federate with a limited set of servers, or retroactively make the room no longer federate with any other server, similar to setting the =m.federate= value on the [[#m-room-create][m.room.create]] event.

*** [[#id605][13.29.1   =m.room.server_acl=]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.room.server_acl
:END:

- /State Event/ :: =state_key=: A zero-length string.

An event to indicate which servers are permitted to participate in the room. Server ACLs may allow or deny groups of hosts. All servers participating in the room, including those that are denied, are expected to uphold the server ACL. Servers that do not uphold the ACLs MUST be added to the denied hosts list in order for the ACLs to remain effective.

The =allow= and =deny= lists are lists of globs supporting =?= and =*= as wildcards. When comparing against the server ACLs, the suspect server's port number must not be considered. Therefore =evil.com=, =evil.com:8448=, and =evil.com:1234= would all match rules that apply to =evil.com=, for example.

The ACLs are applied to servers when they make requests, and are applied in the following order:

1. If there is no =m.room.server_acl= event in the room state, allow.
2. If the server name is an IP address (v4 or v6) literal, and =allow_ip_literals= is present and =false=, deny.
3. If the server name matches an entry in the =deny= list, deny.
4. If the server name matches an entry in the =allow= list, allow.
5. Otherwise, deny.

Note

Server ACLs do not restrict the events relative to the room DAG via authorisation rules, but instead act purely at the network layer to determine which servers are allowed to connect and interact with a given room.

Warning

Failing to provide an =allow= rule of some kind will prevent *all* servers from participating in the room, including the sender. This renders the room unusable. A common allow rule is =[ "*" ]= which would still permit the use of the =deny= list without losing the room.

Warning

All compliant servers must implement server ACLs. However, legacy or noncompliant servers exist which do not uphold ACLs, and these MUST be manually appended to the denied hosts list when setting an ACL to prevent them from leaking events from banned servers into a room. Currently, the only way to determine noncompliant hosts is to check the =prev_events= of leaked events, therefore detecting servers which are not upholding the ACLs. Server versions can also be used to try to detect hosts that will not uphold the ACLs, although this is not comprehensive. Server ACLs were added in Synapse v0.32.0, although other server implementations and versions exist in the world.

Note

Port numbers are not supported because it is unclear to parsers whether a port number should be matched or an IP address literal. Additionally, it is unlikely that one would trust a server running on a particular domain's port but not a different port, especially considering the server host can easily change ports.

Note

CIDR notation is not supported for IP addresses because Matrix does not encourage the use of IPs for identifying servers. Instead, a blanket =allow_ip_literals= is provided to cover banning them.

*** [[#id606][13.29.2   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-25
:END:

Clients are not expected to perform any additional duties beyond sending the event. Clients should describe changes to the server ACLs to the user in the user interface, such as in the timeline.

Clients may wish to kick affected users from the room prior to denying a server access to the room to help prevent those servers from participating and to provide feedback to the users that they have been excluded from the room.

*** [[#id607][13.29.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-15
:END:

Servers MUST prevent blacklisted servers from sending events or participating in the room when an [[#m-room-server-acl][m.room.server\_acl]] event is present in the room state. Which APIs are specifically affected are described in the Server-Server API specification.

Servers should still send events to denied servers if they are still residents of the room.

*** [[#id608][13.29.4   Security considerations]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: security-considerations-14
:END:

Server ACLs are only effective if every server in the room honours them. Servers that do not honour the ACLs may still permit events sent by denied servers into the room, leaking them to other servers in the room. To effectively enforce an ACL in a room, the servers that do not honour the ACLs should be denied in the room as well.

** [[#id609][13.30   User, room, and group mentions]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-room-and-group-mentions
:END:

This module allows users to mention other users, rooms, and groups within a room message. This is achieved by including a [[../appendices.html#matrix-to-navigation][matrix.to URI]] in the HTML body of an [[#m-room-message][m.room.message]] event. This module does not have any server-specific behaviour to it.

Mentions apply only to [[#m-room-message][m.room.message]] events where the =msgtype= is =m.text=, =m.emote=, or =m.notice=. The =format= for the event must be =org.matrix.custom.html= and therefore requires a =formatted_body=.

To make a mention, reference the entity being mentioned in the =formatted_body= using an anchor, like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {
  "body": "Hello Alice!",
  "msgtype": "m.text",
  "format": "org.matrix.custom.html",
  "formatted_body": "Hello <a href='https://matrix.to/#/@alice:example.org'>Alice</a>!"
  }
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** [[#id610][13.30.1   Client behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-behaviour-26
:END:

In addition to using the appropriate =matrix.to URI= for the mention, clients should use the following guidelines when making mentions in events to be sent:

- When mentioning users, use the user's potentially ambiguous display name for the anchor's text. If the user does not have a display name, use the user's ID.
- When mentioning rooms, use the canonical alias for the room. If the room does not have a canonical alias, prefer one of the aliases listed on the room. If no alias can be found, fall back to the room ID. In all cases, use the alias/room ID being linked to as the anchor's text.
- When referencing groups, use the group ID as the anchor's text.

The text component of the anchor should be used in the event's =body= where the mention would normally be represented, as shown in the example above.

Clients should display mentions differently from other elements. For example, this may be done by changing the background color of the mention to indicate that it is different from a normal link.

If the current user is mentioned in a message (either by a mention as defined in this module or by a push rule), the client should show that mention differently from other mentions, such as by using a red background color to signify to the user that they were mentioned.

When clicked, the mention should navigate the user to the appropriate room, group, or user information.

Clients which understand =m.room.tombstone= events and the =predecessor= field on =m.room.create= events should communicate to the user that the room was upgraded. One way of accomplishing this would be hiding the old room from the user's room list and showing banners linking between the old and new room - ensuring that permalinks work when referencing the old room. Another approach may be to virtually merge the rooms such that the old room's timeline seamlessly continues into the new timeline without the user having to jump between the rooms.

*** [[#id616][13.31.3   Server behaviour]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: server-behaviour-16
:END:

When the client requests to upgrade a known room to a known version, the server:

1. Checks that the user has permission to send =m.room.tombstone= events in the room.

2. Creates a replacement room with a =m.room.create= event containing a =predecessor= field and the applicable =room_version=.

3. Replicates transferable state events to the new room. The exact details for what is transferred is left as an implementation detail, however the recommended state events to transfer are:

   - =m.room.server_acl=
   - =m.room.encryption=
   - =m.room.name=
   - =m.room.avatar=
   - =m.room.topic=
   - =m.room.guest_access=
   - =m.room.history_visibility=
   - =m.room.join_rules=
   - =m.room.power_levels=

   Membership events should not be transferred to the new room due to technical limitations of servers not being able to impersonate people from other homeservers. Additionally, servers should not transfer state events which are sensitive to who sent them, such as events outside of the Matrix namespace where clients may rely on the sender to match certain criteria.

4. Moves any local aliases to the new room.

5. Sends a =m.room.tombstone= event to the old room to indicate that it is not intended to be used any further.

6. If possible, the power levels in the old room should also be modified to prevent sending of events and inviting new users. For example, setting =events_default= and =invite= to the greater of =50= and =users_default + 1=.

When a user joins the new room, the server should automatically transfer/replicate some of the user's personalized settings such as notifications, tags, etc.

** [[#id617][13.32   Server Notices]]

Homeserver hosts often want to send messages to users in an official capacity, or have resource limits which affect a user's ability to use the homeserver. For example, the homeserver may be limited to a certain number of active users per month and has exceeded that limit. To communicate this failure to users, the homeserver would use the Server Notices room.

The aesthetics of the room (name, topic, avatar, etc) are left as an implementation detail. It is recommended that the homeserver decorate the room such that it looks like an official room to users.

*** [[#id618][13.32.1   Events]]

Notices are sent to the client as normal =m.room.message= events with a =msgtype= of =m.server_notice= in the server notices room. Events with a =m.server_notice= =msgtype= outside of the server notice room must be ignored by clients.

The specified values for =server_notice_type= are:

=m.server_notice.usage_limit_reached=:

 

The server has exceeded some limit which requires the server administrator to intervene. The =limit_type= describes the kind of limit reached. The specified values for =limit_type= are:

Clients can identify the server notices room by the =m.server_notice= tag on the room. Active notices are represented by the [[#m-room-pinned-events][pinned events]] in the server notices room. Server notice events pinned in that room should be shown to the user through special UI and not through the normal pinned events interface in the client. For example, clients may show warning banners or bring up dialogs to get the user's attention. Events which are not server notice events and are pinned in the server notices room should be shown just like any other pinned event in a room.

The client must not expect to be able to reject an invite to join the server notices room. Attempting to reject the invite must result in a =M_CANNOT_LEAVE_SERVER_NOTICE_ROOM= error. Servers should not prevent the user leaving the room after joining the server notices room, however the same error code must be used if the server will prevent leaving the room.

*** [[#id621][13.32.3   Server behaviour]]

Servers should manage exactly 1 server notices room per user. Servers must identify this room to clients with the =m.server_notice= tag. Servers should invite the target user rather than automatically join them to the server notice room.

** [[#id622][13.33   Moderation policy lists]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: moderation-policy-lists
:END:

With Matrix being an open network where anyone can participate, a very wide range of content exists and it is important that users are empowered to select which content they wish to see, and which content they wish to block. By extension, room moderators and server admins should also be able to select which content they do not wish to host in their rooms and servers.

The protocol's position on this is one of neutrality: it should not be deciding what content is undesirable for any particular entity and should instead be empowering those entities to make their own decisions. As such, a generic framework for communicating "moderation policy lists" or "moderation policy rooms" is described. Note that this module only describes the data structures and not how they should be interpreting: the entity making the decisions on filtering is best positioned to interpret the rules how it sees fit.

Moderation policy lists are stored as room state events. There are no restrictions on how the rooms can be configured (they could be public, private, encrypted, etc).

There are currently 3 kinds of entities which can be affected by rules: =user=, =server=, and =room=. All 3 are described with =m.policy.rule.<kind>= state events. The =state_key= for a policy rule is an arbitrary string decided by the sender of the rule.

Rules contain recommendations and reasons for the rule existing. The =reason= is a human-readable string which describes the =recommendation=. Currently only one recommendation, =m.ban=, is specified.

*** [[#id623][13.33.1   =m.ban= recommendation]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: m.ban-recommendation
:END:

When this recommendation is used, the entities affected by the rule should be banned from participation where possible. The enforcement of this is deliberately left as an implementation detail to avoid the protocol imposing its opinion on how the policy list is to be interpreted. However, a suggestion for a simple implementation is as follows:

- Is a =user= rule...

  - Applied to a user: The user should be added to the subscriber's ignore list.
  - Applied to a room: The user should be banned from the room (either on sight or immediately).
  - Applied to a server: The user should not be allowed to send invites to users on the server.

- Is a =room= rule...

  - Applied to a user: The user should leave the room and not join it ([[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2270][MSC2270]]-style ignore).
  - Applied to a room: No-op because a room cannot ban itself.
  - Applied to a server: The server should prevent users from joining the room and from receiving invites to it.

- Is a =server= rule...

  - Applied to a user: The user should not receive events or invites from the server.
  - Applied to a room: The server is added as a denied server in the ACLs.
  - Applied to a server: The subscriber should avoid federating with the server as much as possible by blocking invites from the server and not sending traffic unless strictly required (no outbound invites).

*** [[#id624][13.33.2   Subscribing to policy lists]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: subscribing-to-policy-lists
:END:

This is deliberatly left as an implementation detail. For implementations using the Client-Server API, this could be as easy as joining or peeking the room. Joining or peeking is not required, however: an implementation could poll for updates or use a different technique for receiving updates to the policy's rules.

*** [[#id625][13.33.3   Sharing]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sharing
:END:

In addition to sharing a direct reference to the room which contains the policy's rules, plain http or https URLs can be used to share links to the list. When the URL is approached with a =Accept: application/json= header or has =.json= appended to the end of the URL, it should return a JSON object containing a =room_uri= property which references the room. Currently this would be a =matrix.to= URI, however in future it could be a Matrix-schemed URI instead. When not approached with the intent of JSON, the service could return a user-friendly page describing what is included in the ban list.

*** [[#id626][13.33.4   Events]]
:PROPERTIES:

This module could be used to build a system of shared blacklists, which may create a divide within established communities if not carefully deployed. This may well not be a suitable solution for all communities.

Depending on how implementations handle subscriptions, user IDs may be linked to policy lists and therefore expose the views of that user. For example, a client implementation which joins the user to the policy room would expose the user's ID to observers of the policy room. In future, [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls/1228][MSC1228]] and [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls/1777][MSC1777]] (or similar) could help solve this concern.
