Ement.el is a new Matrix client for Emacs.  It's basic at the moment, but it can be used to send and read messages.

* Screenshots

This is what a room buffer looks like.

# ** MELPA
# 
# If you installed from MELPA, you're done.  Just run one of the commands below.

** Quelpa

The recommended way to install is with [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]], like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Install and load `quelpa-use-package'.
  (package-install 'quelpa-use-package)
  (require 'quelpa-use-package)

  ;; Install `plz' HTTP library (not on MELPA yet).
  (use-package plz
    :quelpa (plz :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/plz.el"))

  ;; Install Ement.
  (use-package ement
    :quelpa (ement :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/ement.el"))
#+END_SRC

** Manual

If you want to install it manually, it's simple enough, but you should know what you're doing, and you're on your own.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

1.  Call command ~ement-connect~ to connect.
2.  Wait for initial sync to complete (which can take a few moments--initial sync JSON requests can be large).
3.  Call command ~ement-view-room~ to select a room buffer to view.

In the room buffer:

-  ~RET~ sends a message.
-  ~TAB~ / ~<backtab>~ moves between messages.
-  ~M-v~ at the top of the buffer loads older messages.
-  ~v~ views an event's source.
-  ~g~ syncs new messages (not necessary if auto sync is enabled; see below).
-  ~r~ selects another room.

** Tips

+  You can customize settings in the ~ement~ group.
     -  Set ~ement-auto-sync~ to sync new messages automatically.
