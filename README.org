Ement.el is a new Matrix client for Emacs.  It's basic at the moment, but it can be used to send and read messages.

** COMMENT MELPA

If you installed from MELPA, you're done.  Just run one of the commands below.

** Quelpa

The recommended way to install is with [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]], like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Load `quelpa-use-package'.
  (require 'quelpa-use-package)

  ;; Install `plz' HTTP library (not on MELPA yet).
  (use-package plz
    :quelpa (plz :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/plz.el"))

  ;; Install Ement.
  (use-package ement
    :quelpa (ement :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/ement.el"))
#+END_SRC

** Manual

If you want to install it manually, it's simple enough, but you should know what you're doing, and you're on your own.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

1.  Call command ~ement-connect~ to connect.
2.  Wait for initial sync to complete (which can take a while--Matrix JSON requests are large).
3.  Use command ~ement-view-room~ to select a room buffer to view.
4.  In the room buffer, press ~RET~ to send a message, and ~g~ to sync new messages.

** Tips

+  You can customize settings in the ~ement~ group.
     -  Set ~ement-auto-sync~ to sync new messages automatically.
