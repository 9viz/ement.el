#+TITLE: Matrix Spec in Org format

This orphan branch has a version of the Matrix client-server spec in Org format.  It was produced by this Pandoc command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pandoc -f html-empty_paragraphs-native_divs-native_spans -t org --strip-comments --wrap=none Client-Server\ API.html >matrix-spec.or
g
#+END_SRC

Then various cleanups were done, some of which are included below:
